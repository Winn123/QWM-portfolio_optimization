  abstract             = {Conventional risk measures may not accurately describe the volatility investors actually experience, especially for portfolios servicing their retirement spending needs. Return volatility rises as its calculated holding period nears 1 year and falls as it lengthens to 10 years. Lower volatility at longer holding periods implies that longer-term mean reversion exists. A portfolio achieves the greatest extra-return benefit by rebalancing over the holding period of highest volatility. Time diversification is helpful, up until long-term uncertainty about the value of reinvested cash flows from dividends leads to rising volatility.},

We apply these measures to a set of daily arithmetically-compounded returns, in U.S. dollar terms, on a set of ten market indices representing the major European markets for a nine-year period from the beginning of 2005 to the end of 2013. The sample period, which incorporates the periods of both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the subsequent European Debt Crisis (EDC), is a challenging one for the application of portfolio investment strategies. The analysis is undertaken via the examination of multiple investment strategies and a variety of hold-out periods and backtests. We commence by using four two-year estimation periods and a subsequent one-year investment hold out period, to analyse a naive 1/N diversification strategy and to contrast its effectiveness with Markowitz mean variance analysis with positive weights. Markowitz optimisation is then compared to various down-side investment optimisation strategies. We begin by comparing Markowitz with CVaR, and then proceed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of Markowitz with various draw-down strategies, utilising a series of backtests. Our results suggest that none of the more sophisticated optimisation strategies appear to dominate naive diversification.},

Thus we are left with an unsatisfying debate conducted in a paradigm where terminal wealth is usually a function only of returns, and where time-weighted measures are assumed to adequately evaluate performance. This paper reviews the major streams in the time diversification literature and argues that more realistic analysis using defensible assumptions is likely to lead to better prescriptions for improved retirement investing},

  abstract    = {This paper analyses various measures of portfolio diversification, and explores the implication in terms of advanced risk reporting techniques. We use the minimal linear torsion approach (Meucci et al. (2013)) to turn correlated constituents into uncorrelated factors, and focus on the effective number of (uncorrelated) bets (ENB), the entropy of the distribution of risk factor contribution to portfolio risk, as a meaningful measure of the degree of diversification in a portfolio.

In an attempt to assess whether a relationship exists between the degree of diversification of a portfolio and its performance in various market conditions, we empirically analyse the diversification of various equity indices and pension fund policy portfolios. We find strong evidence of a significantly positive time-series and cross-sectional relationship between the ENB risk diversification measure and performance in bear markets.

This relationship, however, is highly linear, and the top performing portfolios in severe bear markets are typically portfolios concentrated in safe assets, as opposed to well-diversified portfolios. We also find statistical and economic evidence that this diversification measure has predictive power for equity market returns, a predictive power which becomes substantial over long holding period.

Overall our results suggest that the ENB measure could be a useful addition to the list of risk indicators reported for equity and policy portfolios.},

The paper also shows that assets selected under RQE can protect portfolios from mass destruction (systemic risk) and an empirical illustration suggests that this protection is substantial.},

The risk measure commonly used to select ERC portfolios is volatility. We propose here new developments of the ERC approach using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a risk measure. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions, we also provide an approach to find a CVaR ERC portfolio as a solution of a convex optimization problem. We investigate how these classes of portfolio models (Minimum-Risk, Capital-Diversification, and Risk-Diversification) work on seven investment universes, each with different sources of risk, including equities, bonds, and mixed assets. Then, we highlight some strengths and weaknesses of all portfolio strategies in terms of various performance measures.},

We study international diversification with two dependence measures: correlations and extreme dependence. We discover that dependence has typically increased over time, and document mixed evidence on heavy tails in individual countries.

Moreover, we uncover three additional findings related to dependence. First, the timing of downside risk differs depending on the region. Surprisingly, recent Latin American returns exhibit little downside risk. Second, Latin America exhibits a great deal of correlation complexity. Third, according to the empirical results, correlation does not vary with returns, but extreme dependence does vary monotonically with regional returns.

Our results are consistent with a tradeoff between international diversification and systemic risk. They also suggest international limits to diversification, and that international investors demand some compensation for joint downside risk during extreme events.},

Initially, Sharpe (1964) Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) postulated that security markets can be described by a single factor (market beta). The basic premise of the model is that market participants require a risk premium for investing in high-beta assets that are typically considered more risky than low-beta assets. However, in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, two major trends emerged in the investment industry that laid the groundwork for the rise of factor-based investment strategies: 1) Investors started to evaluate and implement portfolio diversification in terms of underlying systematic risk factors given the failure of active management to provide adequate downside protection. 2) Investors demanded cost-effective, transparent and systematic alternative investment vehicles that could capture most or at least parts of active managers excess return. As a consequence, factor-based investing has grown in popularity and rapidly attracted academics, asset managers and institutional investors.},

DRP strives for maximum diversification along uncorrelated risk sources. A straightforward way to derive uncorrelated risk sources relies on principal components analysis (PCA). While the ensuing statistical factors can be associated with commodity sector bets, the corresponding DRP strategy entails excessive turnover because of the instability of the PCA factors. We suggest an alternative design of the DRP strategy relative to common commodity risk factors that implicitly allows for a uniform exposure to commodity risk premia.},

Specifically, country factor portfolios reflect both common variation, which we define as the global factor, and local variation. On average, a US investor could enjoy a 30 percent reduction in portfolio volatility by investing globally. We also document three other properties of equity factors. Like major asset classes, greater market integration is associated with greater factor co-movement, and factor portfolios of different countries tend to be more correlated during bear stock markets. However, unlike asset classes, the correlations of factor portfolios across countries have not been increasing over the last two decades, making global equity factors a particularly desirable addition to a portfolio.},

Providing an updated review of these models since DeMiguel et al. (2009b), I test sixteen strategies across six empirical datasets to see if indeed progress has been made. However, I find that none of the recently suggested strategies consistently outperforms the 1/N or minimum-variance approach in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return or turnover. This suggests that simple diversification rules are not in fact inefficient, and gains promised by optimal portfolio choice remain unattainable out-of-sample due to large estimation errors in expected returns. Therefore, further research effort should be devoted to both improving estimation of expected returns, and possibly exploring diversification rules that do not require the estimation of expected returns directly, but also use other available information about the stock characteristics.},

This is demonstrated by the large flows into the numerous low-beta and low-volatility strategies that were established in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. The authors examine the beta anomaly in the academic literature and provide an empirical analysis for stocks in the U.S., developed, and emerging markets. Their primary finding is that beta is not a strong predictor of expected returns, but it is useful when used to help reduce risk in a portfolio. The authors present results for an investment strategy that filters out the highest-beta stocks while controlling for concentration risks by country and sector. The study finds mixed results for beta as an anomaly: Low beta outperforms for international markets, underperforms in emerging markets, and is flat in the U.S. markets. None of these differences appears to be statistically significant. The authors find beta is very useful, however, as a tool for controlling risk, especially in the context of strategies that diversify across countries and sectors.},

This seems to require that in a given working universe, or market, the investment should be spread among all (or almost all) the available assets. Indeed, this is what some classical investment strategies, like Equally-Weighted portfolios, or more recent and refined ones, like Risk Parity, actually recommend.

The purpose of this work consists in giving some empirical evidence of the fact that diversifying through the use of larger portfolios is not the best way to achieve an improvement in out-of-sample performance. More precisely, we investigate the role of the restriction on the number of assets in a portfolio (a cardinality constraint) on the in-sample and out-of-sample outcomes of the Equally-Weighted approach and of some well-known portfolio selection models that minimize risk through the use of Variance, Semi-Mean Absolute Deviation, and Conditional Value-at-Risk.

Our empirical analysis is based on some new and on some publicly available benchmark data sets often used in the literature.},

Moreover, upside diversification is undesirable. The authors first describe the mathematics of conditional correlations assuming returns are normally distributed. Then they present empirical results across a wide variety of assets, which reveal that, unlike the theoretical conditional correlations, empirical correlations are significantly asymmetric. Finally, the authors show that a portfolio construction technique called full-scale optimization produces portfolios in which the component assets exhibit relatively lower correlations on the downside and higher correlations on the upside than mean-variance optimization portfolios.},

On the other hand, risk-parity portfolios include all investable assets, and idiosyncratic risk has little effect on weight magnitude.

The algebraic forms for optimal asset weights derived in this article yield generalizable properties of risk-based portfolios, in contrast to empirical simulations that employ a specific set of historical returns, proprietary risk models, and multiple constraints.

Often attributed to a preference for familiarity, this 'correlation puzzle' further reduces effective diversification. We use a multi-country general equilibrium model of portfolio choice to study how bilateral equity holdings are affected by return correlations among alternative destination and source countries. From the theoretical model, we develop an empirical approach to estimate a gravity equation for equity holdings that incorporates the overall covariance structure in a theoretically rigorous yet tractable manner. Estimation using this approach resolves the correlation puzzle, and finds that international investors do seek the diversification benefits of low cross-country correlations, as theory would predict.},

Using volatility swap returns as a measure of the payoff to the VRP, we see that the returns to a short volatility position are correlated to the volatility of the underlying instrument and to other VRPs in the same asset class. We also find that the returns are relatively uncorrelated to the VRPs of other asset classes and to the traditional equity factors represented by pure factor portfolios (PFPs).

Namely, we extend Rudin and Morgan's (2006) work to numerically solve for the 'Maximum Diversification Index' by means of a genetic algorithm.

Using stock returns data from the S and P-500 index, we show that the MDI can be efficiently implemented to delimit a large set of investable assets by eliminating those subjects that do not improve the diversification characteristics of the underlying portfolio pool. Indeed, a subset of the S and P-500 stocks obtained using the MDI procedure preserves the mean-variance properties of the initial dataset as shown by the ex-post efficient frontiers.},

The recent development of risk-based portfolio construction methods, which emphasise diversification separately from volatility reduction, challenges this equivalence. Using a point-in-time database of liquid equities listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange between 1998 and 2016, a numerical simulation technique is employed to study the behaviour of a range of diversification measures as a portfolio-level attribute and assess and compare their usefulness in estimating out-of-sample portfolio volatility. The empirical performance of maximum diversification portfolios based on each measure is then investigated. It is found that a portfolio?s diversification level is a significant predictor of future portfolio risk beyond that of historic volatility, and that the empirical performance of maximum diversification portfolios, attractive in all cases, depends critically on the definition of diversification applied.},

  abstract     = {Recent history has provided an excellent laboratory to test the robustness of investment processes. Despite claims of diversification, most balanced portfolios and pension funds were concentrated on equity risk and, consequently, key investment decisions ultimately consisted in a single binary bet: buy or sell equity. This led to pro-cyclical returns and generated a broad debate on the effectiveness of active management in generating performance in difficult market conditions.

In 2011 AMUNDI Italy decided to revise the asset allocation process starting with a reinterpretation of portfolio diversification in terms of Diversification Across Macroeconomic Scenarios (DAMS). The main ambitions of DAMS are: (i) to explain complex patterns of large investment universes in terms of a limited number of factors and (ii) to catch up the market risk premium without being exposed to specific macroeconomic dynamics and asset idiosyncratic risk. In a previous study we illustrated the DAMS principle and implications in terms of asset segmentation.

The aim of this paper is to move towards a new framework for multi-asset portfolio management, what we call DAMS second generation. DAMS first generation is enriched with new concepts and tools that enable us (i) to infer market expectations on relevant macroeconomic factors (growth and inflation) and global risk premium, and (ii) to properly manage portfolios via strategic and tactical asset allocation.},

However, achieving true diversification is easier said than done, especially when we don't fully know what we mean when we're talking about diversification. While the qualitative purpose of diversification is well-known, a satisfactory quantitative definition of portfolio diversification is not. In this report, we summarise a wide range of diversification measures, focussing our efforts on those most commonly used in practice. We categorise each measure based on which portfolio aspect it focusses on: cardinality, weights, returns, risk or higher moments. We then apply these measures to a range of South African equity indices, thus giving a diagnostic review of historical local equity diversification and, perhaps more importantly, providing a description of the investable opportunity set available to fund managers in this space. Finally, we introduce the idea of diversification profiles. These regime-dependent profiles give a much richer description of portfolio diversification than their single-value counterparts and also allow one to manage diversification proactively based on one's view of future market conditions.},

In this article, the authors highlight some drawbacks of the DD measure and go on to propose an alternative measure based on exponential entropy that overcomes the identified shortcomings. The authors present the properties of this new measure and propose it as an alternative for portfolio optimization that incorporates higher moments of asset returns, such as skewness and excess kurtosis.},

Thus, the resulting efficient frontier extends to a three dimensional surface which includes the original efficient frontier according to Markowitz. Starting with the original Markowitz model through improvements in stochastic modelling in terms of risk measures, copulas, fat tails, etc., leaving the pure return/risk context can be interpreted as a third model generation.},

Emphasis is placed on risk management, given our perspective (shared by many other practitioners), that retaining above average portfolio performance in current market environment depends strongly on having an effective risk management process.

We rely on a comprehensive survey of the literature to describe stylized facts of market returns and main categories of asset allocation methodologies, including Modern Portfolio Theory, Black-Litterman model, factor-based and risk-based strategies. Furthermore, we present both criticisms and defenses of strategies, together with potential issues identified by practitioners and corresponding solutions (if they do exist).

We outline recent enhancements to various types of portfolio strategies, and analyze how to incorporate (in the asset allocation framework) constraints, regularization, personal views, stylized features of empirical market data, and forward information given by financial options market data.

More prominence is given to strategies (risk parity, risk factors, factor investing, smart beta, dynamic, etc.) that were shown to deliver better portfolio performance in terms of returns, diversification, risk, etc. We also discuss a wide ranging collection of performance measures proposed in the literature for quantifying portfolio return, risk and diversification, identify which such measures are most popular with practitioners, and which corresponding strategies have best results (as shown in the literature).

Since a major topic of this study is managing risks, we provide details on the types of risk that portfolios may be exposed to, on approaches and strategies to handle such exposures, with highlighting of tail risk management. Portfolio insurance is also discussed.

We also describe practical aspects needed for a successful portfolio management, including robust estimation of covariances, correlations and model parameters, numerical optimization methods, key questions and issues identified by practitioners, Monte Carlo simulation, comprehensive testing framework, stress testing, available software implementations (usually in R), etc.

To summarize, the study analyzes all ingredients that are required, in our opinion, to deliver portfolios with above average performances and resilient to most risks, and concentrates on the strategies which have emerged as frontrunners in the last few years, both in the literature and in the market.},

We utilize a rolling-sample approach and compare the out-of-sample performance and tail risk of various optimal strategies to that of the naive diversification strategy. Using portfolios consisting of individual stocks, we show that for portfolios containing relatively small number of stocks, naive diversification outperforms optimal mean-variance diversification and is less exposed to tail risk. However, for relatively large number of stocks in the portfolio, naive diversification maintains its superior performance but increases tail risk and results in more concave portfolio returns. These results imply that the outperformance of naive diversification acts as compensation for the increase in tail risk and concavity.},

That certainly was true in the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and since then correlations have generally remained elevated as markets switch between binary risk-on/risk-off environments. However, we believe it would be wrong to interpret these developments as conclusive evidence of the death of diversification.

First, academics (Asness, Israelov and Liew [2011]) have stressed that while diversification often fails in short-term panics - especially one as systemic as the 2007-2009 crisis - it does effectively reduce downside risks over longer horizons. Second, high-quality bonds have fairly consistently provided positive returns during stressful market environments. Third, in this article, we argue and show that factor diversification has been more effective than asset-class diversification in general and, in particular, during crises. The last two arguments challenge the concentration in equity risk found in most institutional portfolios, which is also a central argument in favor of more risk-balanced, so-called risk parity, portfolios.

Traditional asset-class diversification involves allocating nominal dollars to various asset classes and their subsets. Several large institutions have begun to explore an alternative perspective of factor allocation, asking: What are the most important factors driving our portfolio returns? This perspective involves at least two changes. First, focus is shifted from dollar allocations to risk allocations. This change often reveals the dominant role of the most volatile asset classes and the portfolio's dependence on equity market direction. Second, portfolio analysis is extended beyond asset classes to dynamic strategy styles or to underlying risk factors. Fundamental factors such as growth, inflation and liquidity are naturally interesting, but they are inherently hard to measure. Most investors prefer investable factors and therefore use market-based proxies - equities for growth, Treasuries for deflation and commodities for inflation.},

The study took a descriptive research design approach on weekly performance of a sample of 7 balanced mutual funds for the year 2013.The study used secondary data sources available at the Capital Market Authority offices and from each mutual funds. The portfolio return was determined by computing the changes in prices of the balanced fund as traded at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) while diversification was determined from the level of Unsystematic Risk in the Performance. The study used the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple linear regression equation. Control variables of the size and age of the fund were introduced in the regression model. The results indicated the existence of a positive relationship between the Unsystematic Risk and Performance of balanced mutual funds with a beta coefficient of 0.069 (t=4.971, p 0.5.

The authors find that the emerging-market ETF portfolio has very low correlations with IVV during the period of the study. Emerging-market ETF portfolios delivered better absolute performance (returns and wealth) but also had much higher risk (standard deviation of returns). However, the risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe and Omega ratios) of IVV was better than that of the emerging-market ETF portfolio. They also look at the effect of adding some emerging-market ETFs to IVV during the period of study. The authors find that adding some emerging-market ETFs to IVV leads to higher absolute returns, better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe and Omega ratios), higher cumulative returns, and increased wealth for U.S. investors. Results are statistically significant at 1\% in all cases. Therefore, U.S. investors should add some emerging-market ETFs to their domestic allocation based on their risk tolerance for better performance (absolute and risk-adjusted).},

They detect no evidence of contagion but rather of herding behavior among these assets. The variation was more pronounced during market declines, but differed in extent across economic expansions and contractions. Finally, shocks from one asset class to another were not persistent, meaning that the assets were able to absorb the shocks and quickly return to normalcy.

The implications for portfolio decisions are clear: Even well-diversified portfolios must be updated to reflect changing economic and financial environments, and past asset behavior does not imply similar future behavior.},

Instead of looking for nominal diversification, investors may prefer a diversification of the risk factors that drive portfolio returns. In recent papers, risk factors have been modelled by principal components following Partovi and Caputo (2004). Meucci et al.

Although PCs are useful for dimensionality reduction, they are arbitrary because any rotation of the PC basis yields an equally uncorrelated basis. This is problematic because we theoretically demonstrate that any portfolio is the factor-risk-parity portfolio corresponding to a specific uncorrelated basis. To overcome this problem, we rely on the factor-risk-parity portfolio based on the independent components (ICs), which are the rotation of the PCs that are maximally independent, and thus, account for higher-order moments. We propose a shrinkage portfolio that is obtained by combining the minimum-variance portfolio and the IC-risk-parity portfolio. We also show how to exploit the near independence of the ICs to parsimoniously estimate the factor-risk-parity portfolio with respect to Value-at-Risk. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that shrinkage portfolios based on the IC basis outperform those based on the PC basis, as well as the minimum-variance portfolio.},

  abstract             = {In this dissertation, we study a series of diversification strategies in order to improve the understanding of the diversification of investments that was mathematically established by Harry Markowitz. Even though Modern Portfolio Theory considers a trade-off between generating high returns and lowering risks, investment processes inspired by the concept of diversification are generally only addressed with their diversification benefits. Therefore, we analyze the diversification strategies by using portfolio optimization techniques that primarily originated from the mean-variance framework, which considers returns as well as risks with equal importance, in order to more fully understand the quantifiable consequences of various diversification strategies. First, we investigate passive investing and performance benchmarking through analyzing the two most popular equity benchmark portfolios: the cap-weighted portfolio, and the equally-weighted portfolio. As conventional portfolio performance evaluations occur relative to benchmarks, the performance evaluation of the benchmark itself has never been a trivial issue. Thus, an alternative methodology for portfolio performance evaluation that can be conducted without peer information is proposed, and we find little or no evidence of either benchmark portfolio performing better than the average portfolio. In terms of performance benchmarking, however, equally-weighted portfolios exhibit more desirable properties than cap-weighted portfolios. Second, we examine the quantitative properties of asset allocation and asset classification. We derive and compare the closed form expressions for the portfolio performances of asset allocation and direct security selection, and we find that the majority of investors can benefit from employing asset allocation. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the design of asset classes is a critical factor in determining the portfolio performance of employing asset allocation. Hence, we further test the two most widely used within-stock asset classification schemes, i.e. style and industry classifications, and find that the asset designs should not focus on diversification benefits only.

Third, we discuss the viability of robo-advising, which was recently developed during the ongoing expansion of financial technology (FinTech). Robo-advising attempts to lower the entry barrier to financial advising through utilizing automated but personalized algorithms, in order to attract investors with smaller accounts, who are ineligible to receive traditional financial advising services. We investigate the relationship between portfolio size and risk in order to examine the viability of roboadvisers in providing diversification benefits with limited portfolio sizes. The results indicate that a substantial investment is not necessary to gain diversification benefits.},

The evaluation of the proposed averaging rules on empirical and simulated datasets shows that each rule achieves a consistently higher risk-adjusted performance than 1/N, while all individual portfolio strategies considered in the averaging exercise do not. I find that the observed performance gains are economically and statistically significant. The performance gains are attributable to persistent diversification effects between the portfolio strategies under consideration, as well as to empirical characteristics in portfolio returns that are exploited by one of the averaging rules.},

This finding is due to insufficient data on past returns, which limit investors' ability to accurately estimate the means and covariance structure of securities. The resulting high estimation errors eliminate the benefits of using the means and covariance matrix as compared to the naive strategy in portfolio optimization. Using value-weighted indexes, characteristic-sorted portfolios, or portfolios defined by principal components as underlying assets in mean-variance optimization does not help. At the same time, increasing data frequency or adding data on past earnings may in some cases make mean-variance optimization useful.},

The authors analyze this trade-off in a multi-asset universe with great potential for static diversification. The regime-based approach is centered around a regime-switching model with time-varying parameters that can match financial markets' behavior and a new, more intuitive way of inferring the hidden market regimes. The empirical results show that regime-based asset allocation is profitable, even when compared to a diversified benchmark portfolio.

The degree to which different entities, (markets, groups of securities, etc.), have different measures of their corresponding distributions tells us the extent to which they are different, aiding participants looking for diversification or looking for more of the same thing. We demonstrate a relationship between covariance and distance measures based on a generic extension of Stein's Lemma.

Numerous simulations applied to different universes have been documented in support of these approaches based on their apparent outperformance versus passive market capitalization-weighted or static fixed-weight portfolios. Many studies attribute the better performance of these risk-based asset allocation approaches to superior diversification.

Given the absence of clearly defined investment objective functions behind these approaches as well as the metrics used by these studies to evaluate ex post performance, Lee puts these approaches into the same context of mean-variance efficiency in an attempt to understand their theoretical underpinnings. In doing so, he hopes to shed some light on what these approaches attempt to achieve and on the characteristics of the investment universe, if indeed these approaches are meant to approximate mean-variance efficiency. Rather than adding to the already large collection of simulation results, Lee uses some simple examples to compare and contrast the portfolio and risk characteristics of these approaches. He also reiterates that any portfolio which deviates from the market capitalization-weighted portfolio is an active portfolio.

He concludes that there is no theory to predict, ex ante, that any of these risk-based approaches should outperform.},

Yet diversification can mean different things to different people and there no consensus on how it is measured nor is there a broadly accepted metric for reporting of diversification. Sometimes, there is confusion in understanding diversification and how it differs from hedging. We may say that diversification and hedging both have the same objective i.e. reducing the risk of a portfolio, but diversification is obtained using correlated (in absolute value) securities, while hedging is achieved with correlated securities. In this paper we propose a new index to measure the diversification of a portfolio.

Diversification has a lot to do with the number of stocks in a portfolio. Adding stocks to a portfolio increases the level of diversification, and consequently leads to risk reduction up to a certain number of stocks, beyond which additional stocks are of no benefit, in terms of risk reduction. To explain this phenomenon, this paper investigates the relationship between portfolio diversification and concentration using a genetic algorithm. To quantify diversification, we use the portfolio Diversification Index (PDI). In the case of concentration, we introduce a new quantification method. Concentration is quantified as complexity of the correlation matrix. The proposed method quantifies the level of dependency (or redundancy) between stocks in a portfolio. By contrasting the two methods it is shown that the optimal number of stocks that optimizes diversification depends on both number of stocks and average correlation. Our result shows that, for a given universe, there is a set of Pareto optimal portfolios containing a different number of stocks that simultaneously maximizes diversification and minimizes concentration. The choice portfolio among the Pareto set will depend on the preference of the investor. Our result also suggests that an ideal condition for the optimal number of stocks is when variance reduction benefit of diversification is off-set by the variance contribution of complexity.},

Classical and more modern hierarchical clustering methods are tested, such as Simple Linkage or Directed Bubble Hierarchical Tree for example. A simple and efficient capital allocation within and across clusters of assets at multiple hierarchical levels is computed. The out-of-sample performances of hierarchical clustering based portfolios and more traditional risk-based portfolios are evaluated across three disparate datasets. To avoid data snooping, the comparison of profit measures is assessed using the bootstrap based model confidence set procedure (Hansen et al. (2011)). The empirical results indicate that hierarchical clustering based portfolios are robust, truly diversified and achieve statistically better risk-adjusted performances than commonly used portfolio optimization techniques.},

This paper proposes a new dynamic portfolio strategy based on the time-varying structures of MST networks in Chinese stock markets, where the market condition is further considered when using the optimal portfolios for investment. A portfolio strategy comprises two stages: selecting the portfolios by choosing central and peripheral stocks in the selection horizon using five topological parameters, i.e., degree, betweenness centrality, distance on degree criterion, distance on correlation criterion and distance on distance criterion, then using the portfolios for investment in the investment horizon. The optimal portfolio is chosen by comparing central and peripheral portfolios under different combinations of market conditions in the selection and investment horizons. Market conditions in our paper are identified by the ratios of the number of trading days with rising index or the sum of the amplitudes of the trading days with rising index to the total number of trading days. We find that central portfolios outperform peripheral portfolios when the market is under a drawup condition, or when the market is stable or drawup in the selection horizon and is under a stable condition in the investment horizon. We also find that the peripheral portfolios gain more than central portfolios when the market is stable in the selection horizon and is drawdown in the investment horizon. Empirical tests are carried out based on the optimal portfolio strategy. Among all the possible optimal portfolio strategy based on different parameters to select portfolios and different criteria to identify market conditions, 65dollar; of our optimal portfolio strategies outperform the random strategy for the Shanghai A-Share market and the proportion is 70dollar; for the Shenzhen A-Share market.},

Residuals are then an ultimate input for all the algorithms to arrive at probability of centrality (PoC) - an impure probability where values near 1 signalize high probability of a stock being central in the network. Several investment strategies are created based on PoC and tested on data from major US stock market indices.

Recent research, however, has shown that focusing on risk-factor allocations, rather than asset class allocations, can result in better risk-adjusted portfolio performance. The existing literature has focused on simple allocation strategies such as equal-weighted and equal-risk-weighted portfolios.

In addition to these simple allocation techniques, this paper compares the performance using mean-variance analysis, and presents evidence that the outperformance of risk-factor diversification may not be as conclusive as has been previously presented in the literature.

While confirming some of the prior findings on risk-factor diversification, the research shows that previous findings may be subject to strong caveats. Specifically, the evidence suggests that the selection of risk-factors, portfolio selection techniques and time-period have a large impact on performance outcomes.},

  abstract    = {Diversification is one the main and most important concept in the financial world. It is often said that diversification is the only free lunch in finance. From a qualitative point of view, the concept of diversification is quite clear: a portfolio is well-diversified if shocks in the individual components do not heavily impact on the overall portfolio. Relatively simple to understand then but profoundly difficult to define. Indeed, there is no broadly accepted precise and quantitative definition of diversification.

Over the years, many different measures of diversification have been developed in the literature, each with its pros and cons. In the framework of this thesis, we have chosen to analyze six of them. Because we wanted to confront the weights concentration criterion with the risk minimization criterion, we decided to select measures that are based on the entropy of the weights and others that are based on the sources of risk. Those six different measures are the Shannon's Entropy, the Diversification Delta, the Diversification Ratio, the MarginalRisk Contributions, the Portfolio Diversification Index and the Effective Number of Bets.},

However, adding five alternative assets (real estate, commodities, hedge funds, emerging markets and private equity) to equity and bond portfolios is shown to be harmful for US investors. We use 19 portfolio models, in conjunction with dummy variable regression, to demonstrate this harm over the 1997-2015 period. This finding is robust to different estimation periods, risk aversion levels, and the use of two regimes. Harmful diversification into alternatives is not primarily due to transactions costs or non-normality, but to estimation risk. This is larger for alternative assets, particularly during the credit crisis which accounts for the harmful diversification of real estate, private equity and emerging markets. Diversification into commodities, and to a lesser extent hedge funds, remains harmful even when the credit crisis is excluded.},

The link between entropy and diversification lies in the notion of uncertainty. We introduce the concept of available diversification in an investment universe and of diversification curves. We build a framework for assembling a fully diversified risk parity-like portfolio with a fundamental-based high-conviction strategy, through a constrained entropy-maximisation process by which a portion of potential portfolio return is swapped for extra diversification. The main results of this study are: mean-variance optimised portfolios are highly concentrated and scarcely related to the asset return assumptions; few basis points of expected returns can be converted into a huge amount of extra diversification that making the portfolio allocation more robust to parameter uncertainty; on a more conceptual ground, we investigate the relationship between portfolio risk and diversification concluding that they should be managed distinctly. The empirical analysis presented in this work shows that entropy is a useful means to alleviate the lack of diversification of portfolios on the efficient frontier.},

Diversification is typically addressed by distributing assets among investment sectors and issuers, preferably with low correlations among their returns, a process that can be called asset diversification. The risk reduction from this type of diversification can be less than expected in the midst of a crisis as correlations increase across market segments.

The authors of this article consider a new approach to managing the active risk profile of a portfolio, an approach that uses active strategies rather than asset allocations as its basic building blocks. The authors show that in this framework, risk reduction is achieved by a combination of two distinct mechanisms asset diversification and signal diversification. Combining alpha strategies based on independent signals can help reduce portfolio risk, even when the returns of the underlying assets are correlated.

One way to achieve signal diversification is by combining strategies with various investment horizons or trading frequencies a technique the authors call horizon diversification. Horizon diversification is an intuitive and robust way to decrease risk in a portfolio of active strategies.},

The corresponding optimization problem can then be solved using the cyclical coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm. This allows us to extend the results of Cazalet et al. and to better understand the trade-off relationships between volatility reduction, tracking error and risk diversification. In particular, we show that the smart beta portfolios differ because they implicitly target different levels of volatility reduction.

We also develop new smart beta strategies by managing the level of volatility reduction and show that they present appealing properties compared to the traditional risk-based portfolios.},

  abstract    = {Risk parity has recently garnered significant attention, particularly owing to its strong performance to more traditional approaches of asset allocation in the last decade. This paper seeks to shed some light on this framework and outline the main advantages, while highlighting some of the concerns currently at the forefront of the minds of risk parity investors - namely leveraged positions in fixed income assets at this point in the interest rate cycle as well as the increasing correlation among asset classes.

The premise of risk parity as an approach to strategic asset allocation is based on maximal diversification of beta (or risk premia) as it emphasises the balanced contribution of various risk exposures to overall portfolio risk. One should essentially remain agnostic to return forecasts on the basis that volatility is a much more stable estimate than return.

Much has been made recently of the increasing correlation among asset classes and the increasing difficulty of achieving diversification - particularly at times of crisis arising from systemic risk. A number of recent studies have examined the benefits of factor diversification over asset class diversification.

The difference is subtle because when one refers to asset classes one is also referring to compensated risk premia. These themselves are therefore factors. One can think of equities as a growth factor, Treasuries as a deflation factor and commodities as an inflation factor. However, risk premia go much further than these traditional factors, as argued in a previous J.P. Morgan Asset Management white paper on alternative beta [15].

Indeed, when one focuses on the risk premia, there are a much broader and more orthogonal set of factors of which one can take advantage. In addition to those mentioned, for example, we can also include the equity value premium, the size premium, the forward rate bias and the merger arbitrage premium among others as further risk premia.

The literature is clear that factor diversification is generally more appealing to asset class diversification. Ilmanen and Kizer [8] go further and point out that factor diversification has been more effective, particularly during periods of crisis.

In this paper, extending risk parity in this direction can be seen to address the core concerns around traditional risk parity and can offer a very attractive approach to strategic asset allocation.

In order to demonstrate this, data is included from several periods going back to 1927 and shows that 'factor premium' risk parity consistently outperforms and is stronger to 'asset class' risk parity.},

The study further contributes to the literature by showing the importance of a complete view, beyond pure tail parameter considerations. Even in the presence of tail parameters being close to normal, the return risk may still be tremendous, and can only be reduced by diversification effects in property portfolios, and only to a certain time-dependent extent.

  abstract             = {This paper conducts a theoretical and empirical investigation of the risks of globally diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds and of optimal intertemporal global portfolio choice for long horizon investors in the presence of permanent cash flow shocks and transitory discount rate shocks to asset values. We show that an upward shift in cross-country one-period return correlations resulting from correlated cash flow shocks increases the risk of global portfolios and reduces investors' willingness to hold risky assets at all horizons. However, a similar upward shift in cross-country one-period return correlations resulting from correlated discount rate shocks has a much more muted effect on long-run portfolio risk and on the willingness to long horizon investors to hold risky assets. Correlated cash flow shocks imply that markets tend to move together at all horizons, thus reducing the scope for global diversification for all investors regardless of their investment horizon. By contrast, correlated discount rate shocks imply that markets tend to move together only transitorily and long-horizon investors can still benefit from global portfolios to diversify long-term cash flow risk. We document a secular increase in the cross-country correlations of stock and government bond returns since the late 1990's. We show that for global equities this increase has been driven primarily by increased cross-country correlations of discount rate shocks, or global capital markets integration, while for bonds it has been driven by both global capital markets integration and increased cross-country correlations of inflation shocks that determine the real cash flows of nominal government bonds. Therefore, despite the significant increase in the short-run correlation of global equity markets, the benefits from global equity portfolio diversification have not declined nearly as much for long-horizon investors as they have for short-horizon investors. By contrast, increased correlation of inflation across markets implies that the benefits of global bond portfolio diversification have declined for long-only bond investors at all horizons. However, it also means that the scope for hedging liabilities using global bonds has increased, benefiting investors with long-dated liabilities. Finally, we show that the well documented negative stock-bond correlation in the U.S. since the late 1990's is a global phenomenon, suggesting that the benefits of stock-bond diversification have increased in all developed markets.},

We propose a new simple approach for efficiently neutralizing the biases from multiple risk variables and demonstrate its superiority relative to stratified sampling and optimization as alternative control methods. We also measure the added value from diversifying the number of factors in each style.

We discuss how the loss of transparency may be quantified in bits, using information theoretic concepts. We find that i) financial transformations imply large information losses, ii) portfolios are more information sensitive than individual stocks only if fundamental analysis is sufficiently informative on the co-movement of assets, that iii) securitisation, in the relevant range of parameters, yields assets that are less information sensitive than the original stocks and that iv) when diversification (or securitisation) is at its best (i.e. when assets are uncorrelated) information losses are maximal. We also address the issue of whether pricing schemes can be introduced to deal with information losses. This is relevant for the transmission of incentives to gather information on the risk origination side. Within a simple mean variance scheme, we find that market incentives are not generally sufficient to make information harvesting sustainable.},

Over the last few years the growing acceptance of life cycle investment products, such as target retirement mutual funds, has renewed interest in this topic. The objective of this article is not to prove or disprove time diversification, but to evaluate whether the concept must be valid for a horizon-based asset allocation framework to be viable and appropriate. Our findings suggest that there is little evidence to support the notion that time moderates the perceived volatility inherent in risky assets. However, we would expect the risk/reward relationships of the past to prevail in the future, and if that is the case, a longer investment horizon may support a willingness and ability to assume the greater uncertainty of equity-centric asset allocations. This may be true particularly for younger investors for whom the allocation to human capital and the risk posed by the erosion of purchasing power by inflation can reasonably be assumed to be greatest.},

To this end, we investigate ways for domain knowledge to be conveniently incorporated into the analysis, by means of graphs. Next, to relax the assumption of the completeness of graph topology and to equip the graph model with practically relevant physical intuition, we introduce the portfolio cut paradigm. Such a graph-theoretic portfolio partitioning technique is shown to allow the investor to devise robust and tractable asset allocation schemes, by virtue of a rigorous graph framework for considering smaller, computationally feasible, and economically meaningful clusters of assets, based on graph cuts. In turn, this makes it possible to fully utilize the asset returns covariance matrix for constructing the portfolio, even without the requirement for its inversion. The advantages of the proposed framework over traditional methods are demonstrated through numerical simulations based on real-world price data.},

The HS-FP framework is a flexible non-parametric estimation approach that considers future asset class behavior to be conditional on time and market environments, and derives a forward looking distribution that is consistent with this view while remaining close as possible to the prior distribution. The framework derives the forward looking distribution by applying unequal time and state conditioned probabilities to historical observations of asset class returns. This is achieved using relative entropy to find estimates with the least distortion to the prior distribution. Here, we use the HS-FP framework on South African financial market data for asset allocation purposes; by estimating expected returns, correlations and volatilities that are better represented through the measured market cycle. We demonstrated a range of state variables that can be useful towards understanding market environments. Concretely, we compare the out-of-sample performance for a specific configuration of the HS-FP model relative to classic Mean Variance Optimization(MVO) and Equally Weighted (EW) benchmark models. The framework displays low probability of backtest overfitting and the out-of-sample net returns and Sharpe ratio point estimates of the HS-FP model outperforms the benchmark models. However, the results are inconsistent when training windows are varied, the Sharpe ratio is seen to be inflated, and the method does not demonstrate statistically significant out-performance on a gross and net basis.},

  abstract       = {A new framework for portfolio diversification is introduced which goes beyond the classical mean-variance approach and portfolio allocation strategies such as risk parity. It is based on a novel concept called portfolio dimensionality that connects diversification to the non-Gaussianity of portfolio returns and can typically be defined in terms of the ratio of risk measures which are homogenous functions of equal degree. The latter arises naturally due to our requirement that diversification measures should be leverage invariant. We introduce this new framework and argue the benefits relative to existing measures of diversification in the literature, before addressing the question of optimizing diversification or, equivalently, dimensionality. Maximising portfolio dimensionality leads to highly non-trivial optimization problems with objective functions which are typically non-convex and potentially have multiple local optima. Two complementary global optimization algorithms are thus presented. For problems of moderate size and more akin to asset allocation problems, a deterministic Branch and Bound algorithm is developed, whereas for problems of larger size a stochastic global optimization algorithm based on Gradient Langevin Dynamics is given. We demonstrate analytically and through numerical experiments that the framework reflects the desired properties often discussed in the literature.},

We then introduce a novel definition of contributions to risk, which generalizes the "marginal contributions to risk", traditionally used in banks for risk budgeting and in asset management to build risk parity strategies.

The Minimum-Torsion Bets allow us to also introduce a natural diversification score, the Effective Number of Minimum-Torsion Bets, which we use to measure and manage diversification.

We discuss the advantages of the Minimum-Torsion Bets over the traditional approach to diversification based on marginal contributions to risk. We present two case studies, a security-based investment in the stocks of the S\&P 500, and a factor-based investment in the five Fama-French factors.},

We document several findings.

First, dependence has increased over time.

Second, we find evidence of asymmetric dependence or downside risk in Latin America, but less in the G5. The results indicate very little downside risk in East Asia.

Third, East Asian and Latin American returns exhibit some correlation complexity. Interestingly, the regions with maximal dependence or worst diversification do not command large returns. Our results suggest international limits to diversification. They are also consistent with a possible tradeoff between international diversification and systemic risk.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, we have witnessed an alarmingly large and growing amount of literature on portfolio construction approaches focused on risks and diversification rather than estimating expected returns. Numerous simulations, applied to different universes, have been documented in support of these approaches based on their apparent outperformance versus passive market-capitalization weighting or static, fixed weight portfolios. Many studies attribute the better performance of these risk-based asset allocation approaches to superior diversification.

Given the absence of clearly defined investment objective functions behind these approaches as well as the metrics used by these studies to evaluate ex-post performance, we put these approaches into the same context of mean-variance efficiency in an attempt to understand their theoretical underpinnings. In doing so, we hope to shed some light on what these approaches attempt to achieve and on the characteristics of the investment universe, if indeed these approaches are meant to approximate meanvariance efficiency.

Rather than adding to the already large collection of simulation results, we use some simple examples to compare and contrast the portfolio and risk characteristics of these approaches. We also reiterate that any portfolio that deviates from the market capitalization-weighted portfolio is an active portfolio.

Finally, we conclude there is no theory to predict, ex-ante, that any of these riskbased approaches should outperform.},

  abstract       = {The classical approaches to optimal portfolio selection call for finding a feasible portfolio that optimizes a risk measure, or a gain measure, or a combination thereof by means of a utility function or of a performance measure. However, the optimization approach tends to amplify the estimation errors on the parameters required by the model, such as expected returns and covariances. For this reason, the Risk Parity model, a novel risk diversification approach to portfolio selection, has been recently theoretically developed and used in practice, mainly for the case of the volatility risk measure. Here we first provide new theoretical results for the Risk Parity approach for general risk measures. Then we propose a novel framework for portfolio selection that combines the diversification and the optimization approaches through the global solution of a hard nonlinear mixed integer or pseudo Boolean problem. For the latter problem we propose an efficient and accurate Multi-Greedy heuristic that extends the classical single-threaded greedy approach to a multiple-threaded setting. Finally, we provide empirical results on real-world data showing that the diversified optimal portfolios are only slightly suboptimal in-sample with respect to optimal portfolios, and generally show improved out-of-sample performance with respect to their purely diversified or purely optimized counterparts.},

They thought that they had avoided the problem associated with putting all their eggs in one basket as the adage advises. When most assets did fall together in largely simultaneous fashion in the midst of the recent credit crisis, investors rated diversification a failure, and cried out in frustration that correlations had all converged on one. Diversification failed this year, 1 was the title of a New York Times article in the business section in November last year. In another, more recent article,2 one of the large university endowments explained that diversification had failed to protect its asset values. This sentiment was, and is, entirely common. If their eggs were all in different baskets, then it would appear that they were somehow all tied together sharing a common fate when their fates were assumed to have been independent of one another instead. There are several aspects of this that are wrong. Diversification didn't fail; the metaphor of eggs in different baskets doesn't accurately capture the purpose of diversification; and those weren't betas that they diversified across},

We consider a number of portfolio construction approaches designed to capture factor premiums with the appropriate levels of risk controls aiming at increasing information ratios. We show that information ratios can be increased by targeting constant volatility (CV) over time, hedging market beta (HB) and hedging exposures to the size factor, i.e. neutralizing biases in the market capitalization of stocks used in factor strategies. With regard to the neutralization of sector exposures, we find this to be of particular importance for the value and low-risk factors. Finally, we look at the added value of shorting stocks in factor strategies. We find that with few exceptions the contributions to performance from the short leg are inferior to those from the long leg. Thus, long-only strategies can be efficient alternatives to capture these factor premiums. Finally, we find that factor premiums tend to have fatter tails than what could be expected from a Gaussian distribution of returns, but that skewness is not significantly negative in most cases.},

Of the 14 models we evaluate across seven empirical datasets, none is consistently better than the 1/N rule in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, or turnover, which indicates that, out of sample, the gain from optimal diversification is more than offset by estimation error. Based on parameters calibrated to the US equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and its extensions to outperform the 1/N benchmark is around 3000 months for a portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50 assets.

Finance theory and recent literature suggest that investors should diversify their retirement savings across a number of funds. However, the Australian government encourages investors to consolidate retirement savings into just one fund. Using a number of optimization techniques, we investigate which of these two actions would result in the best outcome for investors in terms of risk and return. We find that in the majority of cases investors would be better off not diversifying their holdings; mainly because superannuation funds cannot be short sold.

Consistent with global equity diversification, Markowitz-based optimization methods do not add significant value when allocating across different asset classes. This paper evaluates numerous diversification strategies as a possible remedy against widespread costly investment mistakes of individual investors. Our results reveal that a very broad range of simple heuristic allocation schemes offers similar diversification gains as well-established or recently developed portfolio optimization approaches.

The challenge is to do so without overdiversifying the plan. Hiring too many managers can significantly reduce active risk, leaving the plan with high fees and limited ability to outperform a policy benchmark. We review the number of external investment strategies held by the largest US public and corporate pension funds. Our analysis shows that most large pension funds are overdiversified, allowing us to suggest a simpler framework for moving forward.},

  abstract       = {Following the global financial crisis, a portfolio concentrated in US large cap equity and aggregate fixed income has provided higher returns than diversified portfolios through 2019. Such a prolonged experience causes investors to question the benefits of diversification. This leads us to use a longer history of data across 15 asset classes to understand the historical benefits of diversifying a portfolio with international equity, real assets, and below investment grade fixed income. Our results portray the frequency and magnitude of risk-adjusted return improvement coming from different diversifying asset classes over five-year holding periods. We find that certain asset classes, such as below investment grade fixed income, regularly improve risk-adjusted return of the portfolio, while other asset classes like commodities improve risk-adjusted returns less frequently. Further, we observe that some asset classes do not deliver meaningful risk-adjusted return improvements in the presence of other asset classes. Our conclusion is that investors should continue to build diversified portfolios, but in doing so they should consider that some asset classes more consistently improved risk-adjusted returns than others.},

Portfolios are adaptive, meaning they automatically adjust their allocation in response to changing market conditions. The adjustments are model-based and transparent, and align in terms of frequency and magnitude with the investor’s emotionality. The process looks beyond the risk-focused paradigm in relation to investor profiling, product positioning, and portfolio construction. First, investor profiles distinguish between the attitude toward risk and the attitude toward loss. Second, products differentiate in terms of variance and in terms of skewness. Finally, adaptive portfolios represent a client centric combination of products that lifts the power of diversification to a higher level and ultimately contributes to long term buy-and-hold investor behavior.},

Thus, the loading matrix has a single nonzero element in each row and zeros elsewhere. Such a loading matrix is the sparsest possible for certain number of variables and common factors. For this reason, the proposed method is named sparsest FA (SSFA). It may also be called FA-based variable clustering, since the variables loading the same common factor can be classified into a cluster. In SSFA, all model parts of FA (common factors, their correlations, loadings, unique factors, and unique variances) are treated as fixed unknown parameter matrices and their least squares function is minimized through specific data matrix decomposition. A useful feature of the algorithm is that the matrix of common factor scores is re-parameterized using QR decomposition in order to efficiently estimate factor correlations. A simulation study shows that the proposed procedure can exactly identify the true sparsest models. Real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of the variable clustering performed by SSFA.},

Clustering is a solution for classifying enormous data when there is not any early knowledge about classes. With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using un-supervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

The number of clusters at which the index attains its maximum is a candidate for the optimal number of clusters. The proposed method is applied to simulated bivariate normal data, and further extended for use in circular data. Its performance is compared to the criteria discussed in Tibshirani, Walther, and Hastie (2001).

The proposed method attempts to capture the level of similarity of each of the time series based on sensitivity to observable factors as well as to the unobservable factor structure. The proposed method allows for correlations between observable and unobservable factors and also allows for cross-sectional and serial dependence and heteroscedasticities in the error structure, which are common in financial markets. In addition, theoretical properties are established for the procedure. We apply the method to analyze the returns for over 6000 international stocks from over 100 financial markets. The empirical analysis quantifies the extent to which the U.S. subprime crisis spilled over to the global financial markets. Furthermore, we find that nominal classifications based on either listed market, industry, country or region are insufficient to characterize the heterogeneity of the global financial markets.

The purpose of this article is to put together the two distinct ideas, namely mixtures and copulas, so as to use mixtures of copulas aiming at using them for clustering with respect to the dependence properties of the data. This is accomplished by considering finite mixture of different copulas to represent different dependence structures. We provide properties of the derived models along with the description of an estimation method using an EM algorithm based on the standard approach for mixture models.

We compare 30 cluster validity indices (CVIs) in 720 synthetic and 20 real datasets. We use a new comparison methodology and three clustering algorithms: k-means, Ward and Average-linkage. The CVI performance drops dramatically when noise is present or clusters overlap. Statistical tests suggest a division of three groups of CVIs.},

  abstract       = {We often seek to estimate the impact of an exposure naturally occurring or randomly assigned at the cluster-level. For example, the literature on neighborhood determinants of health continues to grow. Likewise, community randomized trials are applied to learn about real-world implementation, sustainability, and population effects of interventions with proven individual-level efficacy. In these settings, individual-level outcomes are correlated due to shared cluster-level factors, including the exposure, as well as social or biological interactions between individuals. To flexibly and efficiently estimate the effect of a cluster-level exposure, we present two targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). The first TMLE is developed under a non-parametric causal model, which allows for arbitrary interactions between individuals within a cluster. These interactions include direct transmission of the outcome (i.e. contagion) and influence of one individual's covariates on another's outcome (i.e. covariate interference). The second TMLE is developed under a causal sub-model assuming the cluster-level and individual-specific covariates are sufficient to control for confounding. Simulations compare the alternative estimators and illustrate the potential gains from pairing individual-level risk factors and outcomes during estimation, while avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Our results suggest that estimation under the sub-model can result in bias and misleading inference in an observational setting. Incorporating working assumptions during estimation is more robust than assuming they hold in the underlying causal model. We illustrate our approach with an application to HIV prevention and treatment.},

Forecasting time series in these domains with traditional univariate forecasting procedures leaves great potentials for producing accurate forecasts untapped. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have proven recently that they are able to outperform state-of-the-art univariate time series forecasting methods in this context when trained across all available time series. However, if the time series database is heterogeneous, accuracy may degenerate, so that on the way towards fully automatic forecasting methods in this space, a notion of similarity between the time series needs to be built into the methods. To this end, we present a prediction model that can be used with different types of RNN models on subgroups of similar time series, which are identified by time series clustering techniques. We assess our proposed methodology using LSTM networks, a widely popular RNN variant. Our method achieves competitive results on benchmarking datasets under competition evaluation procedures. In particular, in terms of mean sMAPE accuracy, it consistently outperforms the baseline LSTM model and outperforms all other methods on the CIF2016 forecasting competition dataset.},

An empirical application of this approach to international stock market returns is presented. The results suggest that this metric discriminates stock markets reasonably well according to size and the level of development.

Minimax linkage is unique in naturally associating a prototype chosen from the original dataset with every interior node of the dendrogram. These prototypes can be used to greatly enhance the interpretability of a hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, we prove that minimax linkage has a number of desirable theoretical properties; for example, minimax-linkage dendrograms cannot have inversions (unlike centroid linkage) and is robust against certain perturbations of a dataset. We provide an efficient implementation and illustrate minimax linkage's strengths as a data analysis and visualization tool on a study of words from encyclopedia articles and on a dataset of images of human faces.},

Measuring quality is a unsupervised approach that completely depends on edges, whereas measuring accuracy is a supervised approach that measures similarity between the real clustering and the predicted clustering. Accuracy cannot be measured for most of the real-world networks since real clustering is unavailable. Thus, it will be advantageous from the viewpoint of expert systems to develop a quality metric that can assure certain level of accuracy along with the quality of clustering. In this paper we have proposed a set of three quality metrics for graph clustering that have the ability to ensure accuracy along with the quality. The effectiveness of the metrics has been evaluated on benchmark graphs as well as on real-world networks and compared with existing metrics. Results indicate competency of the suggested metrics while dealing with accuracy, which will definitely improve the decision-making in expert and intelligent systems. We have also shown that our metrics satisfy all of the six quality-related properties.},

Results show that price clustering is markedly higher in tech stocks than in nontech stocks during this period of rising, sector-specific, investor sentiment. Second, the author estimates a vector autoregression process and examines the impulse responses of price clustering to exogenous shocks in investor sentiment.

  abstract             = {Clustering refers to the process of extracting maximally coherent groups from a set of objects using pairwise, or high-order, similarities. Traditional approaches to this problem are based on the idea of partitioning the input data into a predetermined number of classes, thereby obtaining the clusters as a by-product of the partitioning process. A radically different perspective of the problem consists in providing a formalization of the very notion of a cluster and considering the clustering process as a sequential search of structures in the data adhering to this cluster notion. In this manuscript we review one of the pioneering approaches falling in the latter class of algorithms, which has been proposed in the early 2000s and has been found since then a number of applications in different domains. It is known as dominant set clustering and provides a notion of a cluster (a.k.a. dominant set) that has intriguing links to game-theory, graph-theory and optimization theory. From the game-theoretic perspective, clusters are regarded as equilibria of non-cooperative "clustering" games; in the graph-theoretic context, it can be shown that they generalize the notion of maximal clique to edge-weighted graphs; finally, from an optimization point of view, they can be characterized in terms of solutions to a simplex-constrained, quadratic optimization problem, as well as in terms of an exquisitely combinatorial entity. Besides introducing dominant sets from a theoretical perspective, we will also focus on the related algorithmic issues by reviewing two state-of-the-art methods that are used in the literature to find dominant sets clusters, namely the Replicator Dynamics and the Infection and Immunization Dynamics. Finally, we conclude with an overview of different extensions of the dominant set framework and of applications where dominant sets have been successfully employed.},

As companies collect more and more data from daily operations, they expect to extract useful knowledge from existing collected data to help make reasonable decisions for new customer requests, e.g. user credit category, confidence of expected return, etc. Banking and financial institutes have applied different data mining techniques to enhance their business performance. Among these techniques, clustering has been considered as a significant method to capture the natural structure of data. However, there are not many studies on clustering approaches for financial data analysis. In this paper, we evaluate different clustering algorithms for analysing different financial datasets varied from time series to transactions. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method to enhance the understanding of inner structure of financial datasets as well as the capability of each clustering method in this context.},

We further find that the information structure is closely associated with global market and global geographical factors, and that each financial index's participation in the global market factor varies over time and presents dynamics. Two patterns, hierarchy and cluster effects, are found to be in the dynamics of the indices' participation in the global market factor.

  abstract             = {We introduce two practical properties of hierarchical clustering methods for (possibly asymmetric) network data: excisiveness and linear scale preservation. The latter enforces imperviousness to change in units of measure whereas the former ensures local consistency of the clustering outcome. Algorithmically, excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational complexity by only clustering a data subset of interest while theoretically guaranteeing that the same hierarchical outcome would be observed when clustering the whole dataset. Moreover, we introduce the concept of representability, i.e. a generative model for describing clustering methods through the specification of their action on a collection of networks. We further show that, within a rich set of admissible methods, requiring representability is equivalent to requiring both excisiveness and linear scale preservation. Leveraging this equivalence, we show that all excisive and linear scale preserving methods can be factored into two steps: a transformation of the weights in the input network followed by the application of a canonical clustering method. Furthermore, their factorization can be used to show stability of excisive and linear scale preserving methods in the sense that a bounded perturbation in the input network entails a bounded perturbation in the clustering output.},

The goal is to study methods that, based on the dissimilarity structure, output hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions indexed by a connectivity parameter. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is built around the concept of admissible methods, which are those that abide by the axioms of value - nodes in a network with two nodes are clustered together at the maximum of the two dissimilarities between them - and transformation - when dissimilarities are reduced, the network may become more clustered but not less. Two particular methods, termed reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, are shown to provide upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Furthermore, alternative clustering methodologies and axioms are considered. In particular, modifying the axiom of value such that clustering in two-node networks occurs at the minimum of the two dissimilarities entails the existence of a unique admissible clustering method.},

We leverage the fact that, for asymmetric networks, every admissible method must be contained between reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, and describe three families of intermediate methods. Grafting methods exchange branches between dendrograms generated by different admissible methods. The convex combination family combines admissible methods through a convex operation in the space of dendrograms, and thirdly, the semi-reciprocal family clusters nodes that are related by strong cyclic influences in the network. An algorithmic framework for the computation of hierarchical clusters generated by reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering as well as the grafting, convex combination, and semi-reciprocal families is presented via matrix operations in a dioid algebra. Finally, the introduced clustering methods and algorithms are exemplified through their application to a network describing the interrelation between sectors of the United States (U.S.) economy.},

  abstract       = {The problem of complex data analysis is a central topic of modern statistical science and learning systems and is becoming of broader interest with the increasing prevalence of high-dimensional data. The challenge is to develop statistical models and autonomous algorithms that are able to acquire knowledge from raw data for exploratory analysis, which can be achieved through clustering techniques or to make predictions of future data via classification (i.e., discriminant analysis) techniques. Latent data models, including mixture model-based approaches are one of the most popular and successful approaches in both the unsupervised context (i.e., clustering) and the supervised one (i.e, classification or discrimination). Although traditionally tools of multivariate analysis, they are growing in popularity when considered in the framework of functional data analysis (FDA). FDA is the data analysis paradigm in which the individual data units are functions (e.g., curves, surfaces), rather than simple vectors. In many areas of application, the analyzed data are indeed often available in the form of discretized values of functions or curves (e.g., time series, waveforms) and surfaces (e.g., 2d-images, spatio-temporal data). This functional aspect of the data adds additional difficulties compared to the case of a classical multivariate (non-functional) data analysis. We review and present approaches for model-based clustering and classification of functional data. We derive well-established statistical models along with efficient algorithmic tools to address problems regarding the clustering and the classification of these high-dimensional data, including their heterogeneity, missing information, and dynamical hidden structure. The presented models and algorithms are illustrated on real-world functional data analysis problems from several application area.},

Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to dene the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. The evaluation procedure has to tackle dicult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme ts a specic data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to nd the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them. The R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it oers also the best clus- tering scheme from dierent results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with dierent distance measures and aggre- gation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate sev- eral clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.},

For many real-world applications, we would like to exploit prior information about the data that imposes constraints on the clustering hierarchy, and is not captured by the set of features available to the algorithm. This gives rise to the problem of hierarchical clustering with structural constraints. Structural constraints pose major challenges for bottom-up approaches like average/single linkage and even though they can be naturally incorporated into top-down divisive algorithms, no formal guarantees exist on the quality of their output. In this paper, we provide provable approximation guarantees for two simple top-down algorithms, using a recently introduced optimization viewpoint of hierarchical clustering with pairwise similarity information (Dasgupta, 2016). We show how to find good solutions even in the presence of conflicting prior information, by formulating a constraint-based regularization of the objective. Furthemore, we explore a variation of this objective for dissimilarity information (Cohen-Addad et al., 2018) and improve upon current techniques. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on a real dataset for the taxonomy application.},

Its goal is to divide (partition) the network into groups (clusters or communities) of "topologically related" nodes, where the resulting topology-based clusters are expected to "correlate" well with node label information, i.e., metadata, such as cellular functions of genes/proteins in biological networks, or age or gender of people in social networks. Even for static data, the problem of network clustering is complex. For dynamic data, the problem is even more complex, due to an additional dimension of the data-their temporal (evolving) nature. Since the problem is computationally intractable, heuristic approaches need to be sought. Existing approaches for dynamic network clustering (DNC) have drawbacks. First, they assume that nodes should be in the same cluster if they are densely interconnected within the network. We hypothesize that in some applications, it might be of interest to cluster nodes that are topologically similar to each other instead of or in addition to requiring the nodes to be densely interconnected. Second, they ignore temporal information in their early steps, and when they do consider this information later on, they do so implicitly. We hypothesize that capturing temporal information earlier in the clustering process and doing so explicitly will improve results. We test these two hypotheses via our new approach called ClueNet. We evaluate ClueNet against six existing DNC methods on both social networks capturing evolving interactions between individuals (such as interactions between students in a high school) and biological networks capturing interactions between biomolecules in the cell at different ages. We find that ClueNet is superior in over 83\% of all evaluation tests. As more real-world dynamic data are becoming available, DNC and thus ClueNet will only continue to gain importance.},

However, none of them consider the effect of covariance among the group of forecasts, even though it could have a dramatic impact on the variance of the group, and therefore on the forecast accuracy. The proposed approach, referred to here as Bagged Cluster ETS, aims to reduce the covariance effect by using partitioning around medoids (PAM) to produce clusters of similar forecasts, then selecting several forecasts from each cluster to create a group with a reduced variance. This approach was tested on various different time series sets from the M3 and CIF 2016 competitions. The empirical results have shown a substantial reduction in the forecast error, considering sMAPE and MASE.},

The proposed model handles simultaneously the heterogeneity across stock markets and over time, i.e., time-constant and time-varying discrete latent variables capture unobserved heterogeneity between and within stock markets, respectively. The results show a clear distinction between two groups of stock markets, each one characterized by different regime switching dynamics that correspond to different expected return-risk patterns.

We identify three regimes: the so-called bull and bear regimes, as well as a stable regime with returns close to 0, which turns out to be the most frequently occurring regime. This is consistent with stylized facts in financial econometrics.},

In the computation of total economic capital, a financial institution faces a considerable amount of model uncertainty related to the estimation of the interdependence amongst the marginal risks. In this paper, we propose to apply a clustering procedure in order to partition a risk portfolio into independent subgroups of positively dependent risks. Based on available data, the portfolio partition so obtained can be statistically validated and allows for a reduction of capital and the corresponding model uncertainty. We illustrate the proposed methodology in a simulation study and two case studies considering an Operational and a Market Risk portfolio. A rule of thumb stems from the various examples proposed: in a mathematical model where the risk portfolio is split into independent subsets with comonotonic dependence within, the smallest VaR-based capital estimate (at the high regulatory probability levels typically used) is produced by assuming that the infinite-mean risks are comonotonic and the finite-mean risks are independent. The largest VaR estimate is instead generated by obtaining the maximum number of independent infinite-mean sums.},

  abstract       = {Density peaks clustering (DPC) algorithm is able to get a satisfactory result with the help of artificial selecting the clustering centers, but such selection can be hard for a large amount of clustering tasks or the data set with a complex decision diagram. The purpose of this paper is to propose an automatic clustering approach without human intervention. Inspired by the visual selection rule of DPC, the judgment index which equals the lower value within density and distance (after normalization) is proposed for selecting the clustering centers. The judgment index approximately follows the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, and each clustering center judgment index is much higher. Hence, it is reasonable that the points are selected as clustering centers if their judgment indices are larger than the upper quantile of GEV. This proposed method is called density peaks clustering based on generalized extreme value distribution (DPC-GEV). Furthermore, taking the computational complexity into account, an alternative method based on density peak detection using Chebyshev inequality (DPC-CI) is also given. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets show that DPC-GEV and DPC-CI can achieve the same accuracy as DPC on most data sets but consume much less time.},

In clustering we likewise assume that there is some underlying class structure in the data, just that we don know it and have no access to class labels C for our sample X, so that we have to infer it from X alone. This is also called an unsupervised statistical learning problem. In neurobiology this problem frequently occurs, for instance, when we suspect that neural cells in a brain area from their morphological and/or electrophysiological characteristics into different types, when gene sets cluster in functional pathways, when we believe that neural spiking patterns generated spontaneously in a given area are not arranged along a continuum but come from discrete categories (as possibly indicative of an attractor dynamics, see Chap. 9), or when rodents appear to utilize a discrete set of behavioral patterns or response strategies. In many such circumstances, we may feel that similarities between observations (observed feature sets) speak for an underlying mechanism that produces discrete types, but how could we extract such apparent structure and characterize it more formally? In fact, we may not just search for one such specific partition but may aim for a hierarchically nested set of partitions, that is, classes may split into subclasses and so on, as is the case with many natural categories and biological taxonomies. For instance, at a superordinate level, we may group cortical cell types into pyramidal cells and interneurons, which then in turn would split into several subclasses (like fast-spiking, bursting, etc.).},

CLoVA concept can be used as alternative instead of using interval based variable selections for PLS. Analyses of different data sets indicate the superiority of CLoVA respect to available variable selection algorithms. Recently we have proposed a new variable selection algorithm, based on clustering of variable concept (CLoVA) in classification problem. With the same idea, this new concept has been applied to a regression problem and then the obtained results have been compared with conventional variable selection strategies for PLS. The basic idea behind the clustering of variable is that, the instrument channels are clustered into different clusters via clustering algorithms. Then, the spectral data of each cluster are subjected to PLS regression. Different real data sets (Cargill corn, Biscuit dough, ACE QSAR, Soy, and Tablet) have been used to evaluate the influence of the clustering of variables on the prediction performances of PLS. Almost in the all cases, the statistical parameter especially in prediction error shows the superiority of CLoVA-PLS respect to other variable selection strategies. Finally the synergy clustering of variable (sCLoVA-PLS), which is used the combination of cluster, has been proposed as an efficient and modification of CLoVA algorithm. The obtained statistical parameter indicates that variable clustering can split useful part from redundant ones, and then based on informative cluster; stable model can be reached.},

To provide insights into the clustering of the exchange-rate time series, we investigate dynamic communities in the network. We show that there is a relationship between an exchange rate's functional role within the market and its position within its community and use a node-centric community analysis to track the temporal dynamics of such roles. This reveals which exchange rates dominate the market at particular times and also identifies exchange rates that experienced significant changes in market role. We also use the community dynamics to uncover major structural changes that occurred in the FX market. Our techniques are general and will be similarly useful for investigating correlations in other markets.},

Firstly, we present a method to transform a set of time series into a network using different distance functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and, consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series distance functions, network generation methods and community detection techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such as k-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.},

Due to that the presented algorithm can be applied in spaces equipped with an arbitrary dissimilarity measure (images, DNA sequences, etc.). Secondly, a correction preventing the formation of clusters of too highly unbalanced sizes is applied: just like in the recently introduced Genie approach, which extends the single linkage scheme, the new method averts a chosen inequity measure (e.g., the Gini-, de Vergottini-, or Bonferroni-index) of cluster sizes from raising above a predefined threshold. Numerous benchmarks indicate that the introduction of such a correction increases the quality of the resulting clusterings significantly.},

  abstract             = {Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, while multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on results and argue that the choice should be carefully justified.},

The focus of this work is to develop comparison-based hierarchical clustering algorithms that do not rely on the principles of ordinal embedding. We show that single and complete linkage are inherently comparison-based and we develop variants of average linkage.

  abstract       = {Feature subset selection is basically an optimization problem for choosing the most important features from various alternatives in order to facilitate classification or mining problems. Though lots of algorithms have been developed so far, none is considered to be the best for all situations and researchers are still trying to come up with better solutions. In this work, a flexible and user-guided feature subset selection algorithm, named as FCTFS (Feature Cluster Taxonomy based Feature Selection) has been proposed for selecting suitable feature subset from a large feature set. The proposed algorithm falls under the genre of clustering based feature selection techniques in which features are initially clustered according to their intrinsic characteristics following the filter approach. In the second step the most suitable feature is selected from each cluster to form the final subset following a wrapper approach. The two stage hybrid process lowers the computational cost of subset selection, especially for large feature data sets. One of the main novelty of the proposed approach lies in the process of determining optimal number of feature clusters. Unlike currently available methods, which mostly employ a trial and error approach, the proposed method characterises and quantifies the feature clusters according to the quality of the features inside the clusters and defines a taxonomy of the feature clusters. The selection of individual features from a feature cluster can be done judiciously considering both the relevancy and redundancy according to user intention and requirement. The algorithm has been verified by simulation experiments with different bench mark data set containing features ranging from 10 to more than 800 and compared with other currently used feature selection algorithms. The simulation results prove the superiority of our proposal in terms of model performance, flexibility of use in practical problems and extendibility to large feature sets. Though the current proposal is verified in the domain of unsupervised classification, it can be easily used in case of supervised classification.},

Optimization that focuses on a single best optimum may not achieve the goal of getting the best answer for the purposes of the experiment. This paper builds upon an algorithm introduced in [1] that is successful for finding multiple optima within the input space of the objective function. Here we introduce an alternative cluster search algorithm for finding these optima, making use of clustering. The cluster search algorithm has several advantages over the earlier algorithm. It gives a forward view of the optima that are present in the input space so the user has a preview of what to expect as the optimization process continues. It employs pattern search, in many instances, closer to the minimum's location in input space, saving on simulator point computations. At termination, this algorithm does not need additional verification that a minimum is a duplicate of a previously found minimum, which also saves on simulator point computations. Finally, it finds minima that can be "hidden" by close larger minima.},

  abstract       = {Time series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance measure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time series objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of time series clustering based on two clustering stages. In a first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time series objects are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmenta- tion. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against two state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising.},

However, we demonstrate that fund families exploit IPO-related investment opportunities, which correlate cross-sectionally for economy-wide reasons, more by creating new funds than by using existing funds. This naturally leads to new fund volume clustering that is correlated with the economic environment. In addition, consistent with fund families strategically exploiting the economic environment, new funds with access to IPO offerings outperform and attract higher investment flows.},

One shortcoming of these dissimilarity measures is that they do not take into account the lead or lag existing between the returns of different stocks which changes with time. Mostly, such stocks with high value of correlation at some lead or lag belong to the same cluster (or sector).

Considering relations among dimensionality reduction, noise trading, and market situations, we empirically investigate the effect of dimensionality-reduction methods-principal component analysis, stacked autoencoder, and stacked restricted Boltzmann machine-on stock selection with cluster analysis in different market situations. Based on the index fluctuation, the market is divided into sideways and trend situations. For the CSI 100 and Nikkei 225 constituent stocks, experimental results show that: (1) in sideways situations, dimensionality reduction hardly improves the performance of stock selection with cluster analysis; (2) the advantage of dimensionality reduction is mainly reflected in trend situations, but whether it is in an up or down trend depends on the market analyzed. More importantly, according to the above findings and assuming that the dimensionality-reduction effect will continue, we propose a rotation strategy with and without dimensionality reduction. The results of experiments show that the proposed rotation strategy outperforms the stock market indices as well as the stock-selection strategies based on dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis. These findings offer practical insights into how dimensionality reduction can be efficiently used for stock selection.},

This work presents a novel method for learning hyperplane separators which minimise this graph cut objective, when data are embedded in Euclidean space. The optimisation problem associated with the proposed method can be formulated as a sequence of univariate subproblems, in which the optimal hyperplane orthogonal to a given vector is determined. These subproblems can be solved in log-linear time, by exploiting the trivial factorisation of the exponential function. Experimentation suggests that the empirical runtime of the overall algorithm is also log-linear in the number of data. Asymptotic properties of the minimum cut hyperplane, both for a finite sample, and for an increasing sample assumed to arise from an underlying probability distribution are discussed. In the finite sample case the minimum cut hyperplane converges to the maximum margin hyperplane as the scaling parameter is reduced to zero. Applying the proposed methodology, both for fixed scaling, and the large margin asymptotes, is shown to produce high quality clustering models in comparison with state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in experiments using a large collection of benchmark datasets.},

  abstract             = {The key to time series clustering is how to characterize the similarity between any two time series. In this paper, we explore a new similarity metric called "cross-predictability": the degree to which a future value in each time series is predicted by past values of the others. However, it is challenging to estimate such cross-predictability among time series in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of time series is much larger than the length of each time series. We address this challenge with a sparsity assumption: only time series in the same cluster have significant cross-predictability with each other. We demonstrate that this approach is computationally attractive, and provide a theoretical proof that the proposed algorithm will identify the correct clustering structure with high probability under certain conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical high-dimensional time series clustering algorithm with a provable guarantee. We evaluate with experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data, and results indicate that our method can achieve more than 80\% clustering accuracy on real-world data, which is 20\% higher than the state-of-art baselines.},

However, these algorithms suffer from a lack of interpretability that is required both at a business and regulatory level. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel two-steps method to explain clusters. A classifier is first trained to predict the clusters labels, then the Single Feature Introduction Test (SFIT) method is run on the model to identify the statistically significant features that characterise each cluster. We describe a real wealth management compliance use-case that highlights the necessity of such an interpretable clustering method. We illustrate the performance of our method through an experiment on financial ratios of U.S. companies.},

  abstract             = {Clustering methods have led to a number of important discoveries in bioinformatics and beyond. A major challenge in their use is determining which clusters represent important underlying structure, as opposed to spurious sampling artifacts. This challenge is especially serious, and very few methods are available when the data are very high in dimension. Statistical Significance of Clustering (SigClust) is a recently developed cluster evaluation tool for high dimensional low sample size data. An important component of the SigClust approach is the very definition of a single cluster as a subset of data sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The implementation of SigClust requires the estimation of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for the null multivariate Gaussian distribution. We show that the original eigenvalue estimation can lead to a test that suffers from severe inflation of type-I error, in the important case where there are huge single spikes in the eigenvalues. This paper addresses this critical challenge using a novel likelihood based soft thresholding approach to estimate these eigenvalues which leads to a much improved SigClust. These major improvements in SigClust performance are shown by both theoretical work and an extensive simulation study. Applications to some cancer genomic data further demonstrate the usefulness of these improvements.},

In experiments, we compare the proposed algorithm QCC with DBSCAN, DP and DAAP algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets.

The goal is to study methods for the determination of hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions indexed by a resolution parameter, induced from the given distance intervals of the metric spaces. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is based on defining admissible methods to be those methods that abide to the axioms of value - nodes in a metric space with two nodes are clustered together at the convex combination of the distance bounds between them - and transformation - when both distance bounds are reduced, the output may become more clustered but not less. Two admissible methods are constructed and are shown to provide universal upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Practical implications are explored by clustering moving points via snapshots and by clustering networks representing brain structural connectivity using the lower and upper bounds of the network distance. The proposed clustering methods succeed in identifying underlying clustering structures via the maximum and minimum distances in all snapshots, as well as in differentiating brain connectivity networks of patients from those of healthy controls.},

We analyze the dynamic correlation network of selected Japanese stock returns as an empirical study of the correlation dynamics at the market level by applying the proposed method. Two types of network clustering algorithms are employed for the dimensionality reduction. Firstly, several stock groups instead of the existing business sector classification are generated by the hierarchical recursive network clustering of filtered stock returns in order to overcome the high dimensionality problem due to the large number of stocks. The stock returns are then filtered in advance to control for volatility fluctuations that can distort the correlation between stocks. Thus, the correlation network of individual stock returns is transformed into a correlation network of group-based portfolio returns. Secondly, the reduced size of the correlation network is extended to a dynamic one by using a model-based correlation estimation method. A time series of adjacency matrices is created on a daily basis as a dynamic correlation network from the estimation results. Then, the correlation network is summarized into only three representative correlation networks by clustering along the time axis. Some intertemporal comparisons of the dynamic correlation network are conducted by examining the differences between the three sub-period networks. Our dynamic correlation network analysis framework is not limited to stock returns, but can be applied to many other financial and non-financial volatile time series data.},

  abstract             = {Clustering is a powerful vehicle to reveal and visualize structure of data. When dealing with time series, selecting a suitable measure to evaluate the similarities/dissimilarities within the data becomes necessary and subsequently it exhibits a significant impact on the results of clustering. This selection should be based upon the nature of time series and the application itself. When grouping time series based on their shape information is of interest (shape-based clustering), using a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is a desirable choice. Using stretching or compressing segments of temporal data, DTW determines an optimal match between any two time series. In this way, time series exhibiting similar patterns occurring at different time periods, are considered as being similar. Although DTW is a suitable choice for comparing data with respect to their shape information, calculating the average of a collection of time series (which is required in clustering methods) based on this distance becomes a challenging problem. As the result, employing clustering techniques like K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means (where the cluster centers - prototypes are calculated through averaging the data) along with the DTW distance is a challenging task and may produce unsatisfactory results. In this study, three alternatives for fuzzy clustering of time series using DTW distance are proposed. In the first method, a DTW-based averaging technique proposed in the literature, has been applied to the Fuzzy C-Means clustering. The second method considers a Fuzzy C-Medoids clustering, while the third alternative comes as a hybrid technique, which exploits the advantages of both the Fuzzy C-Means and Fuzzy C-Medoids when clustering time series. Experimental studies are reported over a set of time series coming from the UCR time series database.},

Unfortunately, there is not always enough historical data to forecast items individually- this is particularly true in e-commerce where there is a long tail of low selling items, and items are introduced and phased out quite frequently, unlike physical stores. In such scenarios, it is preferable to forecast items in well-designed groups of similar items, so that data for different items can be pooled together to fit a single model. In this paper, we first discuss the desiderata for such a grouping and how it differs from the traditional clustering problem. We then describe our approach which is a scalable local search heuristic that can naturally handle the constraints required in this setting, besides being capable of producing solutions competitive with well-known clustering algorithms. We also address the complementary problem of estimating similarity, particularly in the case of new items which have no past sales. Our solution is to regress the sales profile of items against their semantic features, so that given just the semantic features of a new item we can predict its relation to other items, in terms of as yet unobserved sales. Our experiments demonstrate both the scalability of our approach and implications for forecast accuracy.},

Unfortunately, CCMV has been proved to be NP hard and has been posted in front of optimization society as a long-standing challenge. By invoking structural market information and utilizing fast clustering algorithm for classification, we develop in this paper an effective heuristic scheme to identify approximate solutions for large-scale CCMV problems. More specifically, by constructing grouping constraints generated from factor-model based clustering algorithm and attaching them to the mixed integer programming formulation associated with the CCMV problem, we are able to significantly reduce the computational complexity, thus offering a fast algorithm with relatively high quality solution.},

The difference between Pearson correlation and the partial correlation is analyzed and it is found that when conditioned on the market return, Pearson correlation coefficients are generally greater than those of the partial correlation, which implies that the market return tends to drive up the correlation between stock returns. A clustering analysis is then performed to study the market structure given by the partial correlation analysis and the members of the clusters are compared with the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The initial hypothesis is that the firms in the same GICS sector are clustered together since they are in a similar business and environment. However, the result is inconsistent with the hypothesis and most clusters are a mix of multiple sectors suggesting that the traditional approach of using sectors to determine the proximity between stocks may not be sufficient enough to diversify a portfolio.},

The large volume of data in the form of time-series makes it necessary to employ various techniques such as clustering to understand the data and to extract information and hidden patterns. In the field of clustering specifically, time-series clustering, the most important aspects are the similarity measure used and the algorithm employed to conduct the clustering. In this paper, a new similarity measure for time-series clustering is developed based on a combination of a simple representation of time-series, slope of each segment of time-series, Euclidean distance and the so-called dynamic time warping. It is proved in this paper that the proposed distance measure is metric and thus indexing can be applied. For the task of clustering, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is employed. The proposed similarity measure is compared to three existing measures in terms of various criteria used for the evaluation of clustering algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed similarity measure outperforms the rest in almost every dataset used in this paper.},

However, for many real-world applications, nuclear norm approximation to the rank function can only produce a result far from the optimum. To seek a solution of higher accuracy than the nuclear norm, in this letter, we propose a rank approximation based on Logarithm-Determinant. We consider using this rank approximation for subspace clustering application. Our framework can model different kinds of errors and noise. Effective optimization strategy is developed with theoretical guarantee to converge to a stationary point. The proposed method gives promising results on face clustering and motion segmentation tasks compared to the state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms.},

  abstract             = {Many similarity-based clustering methods work in two separate steps including similarity matrix computation and subsequent spectral clustering. However, similarity measurement is challenging because it is usually impacted by many factors, e.g., the choice of similarity metric, neighborhood size, scale of data, noise and outliers. Thus the learned similarity matrix is often not suitable, let alone optimal, for the subsequent clustering. In addition, nonlinear similarity often exists in many real world data which, however, has not been effectively considered by most existing methods. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a model to simultaneously learn cluster indicator matrix and similarity information in kernel spaces in a principled way. We show theoretical relationships to kernel k-means, k-means, and spectral clustering methods. Then, to address the practical issue of how to select the most suitable kernel for a particular clustering task, we further extend our model with a multiple kernel learning ability. With this joint model, we can automatically accomplish three subtasks of finding the best cluster indicator matrix, the most accurate similarity relations and the optimal combination of multiple kernels. By leveraging the interactions between these three subtasks in a joint framework, each subtask can be iteratively boosted by using the results of the others towards an overall optimal solution. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Clustering algorithms do not offer a systematic answer to this simple question. Hence we propose a new framework that can, for the first time, explain cluster assignments in terms of input features in a comprehensive manner. It is based on the novel theoretical insight that clustering models can be rewritten as neural networks, or 'neuralized'. Predictions of the obtained networks can then be quickly and accurately attributed to the input features. Several showcases demonstrate the ability of our method to assess the quality of learned clusters and to extract novel insights from the analyzed data and representations.},

In this analysis, we compare ten model-based clustering methods in terms of their ability to identify such features under four scenarios in which data are simulated with varying levels of variable and temporal dependence. To consider these methods in a realistic environment, we focus our analysis on wind data, where observations are often strongly correlated in time, and the dependence of variables is known to vary across different regional weather patterns. In particular, we assess each method's performance when applied to wind data simulated under a realistic two-regime Markov-switching vector autoregressive (VAR) model with a diurnally varying mean. A Gaussian mixture model and a basic Markov-switching model outperform the other methods considered in terms of misclassification rates and number of clusters identified. These two methods and an additional Markov-switching VAR model are then applied to one year of averaged hourly wind data from twenty meteorological stations, and we find that the methods can identify very different features in the data.

The time series are either given in one batch (offline setting), or they are allowed to grow with time and new time series can be added along the way (online setting). We propose a natural notion of consistency for this problem, and show that there are simple, computationally efficient algorithms that are asymptotically consistent under extremely weak assumptions on the distributions that generate the data. The notion of consistency is as follows. A clustering algorithm is called consistent if it places two time series into the same cluster if and only if the distribution that generates them is the same. In the considered framework the time series are allowed to be highly dependent, and the dependence can have arbitrary form. If the number of clusters is known, the only assumption we make is that the (marginal) distribution of each time series is stationary ergodic. No parametric, memory or mixing assumptions are made. When the number of clusters is unknown, stronger assumptions are provably necessary, but it is still possible to devise nonparametric algorithms that are consistent under very general conditions. The theoretical findings of this work are illustrated with experiments on both synthetic and real data.},

Our objective is to estimate the distributions of the sources. A standard approach to this problem is to model the data as a hidden Markov model (HMM). However, since the data often lacks the Markov or the stationarity properties of an HMM, one can ask whether this approach is still suitable or perhaps another approach is required. In this paper we show that a maximum likelihood HMM estimator can be used to approximate the source distributions in a much larger class of models than HMMs. Specifically, we propose a natural and fairly general non-stationary model of the data, where the only restriction is that the sources do not change too often. Our main result shows that for this model, a maximum-likelihood HMM estimator produces the correct second moment of the data, and the results can be extended to higher moments.},

We use a two-phased experimental approach with visualizations to explore the effects of the different clustering techniques. The choice of clustering technique matters. There is significant variation among techniques, resulting in different "pictures"of the riskiness of the same underlying data when plotted to the visual analytics tool. This sensitivity to clustering methodolgy has the potential to mislead analysts about the riskiness of portfolios. We conclude that further research into the implications of portfolio formation rules is needed, and that visual analytics tools should not limit analysts to a single clustering technique, but instead should provide the facility to explore the data using different techniques.},

A three-week sliding window is used for model calibration, leaving an out of sample period of five weeks for testing. Model calibration is done weekly. Three different rebalancing periods are tested: every 1, 2 and 4 hours. The results show that all clustering algorithms produce more stable portfolios with similar volatility. In this sense, the portfolios volatilities generated by the clustering algorithms are smaller when compare to the portfolio obtained using classical Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) over all the dataset. Hierarchical clustering algorithms achieve the best financial performance obtaining an adequate trade-off between accumulated financial returns and the risk-adjusted measure, Omega Ratio, during the out of sample testing period.},

In this article, we propose a generic framework to make seasonal time series forecasting. The framework combines machine learning techniques (1) to identify the typical seasons and (2) to forecast the likelihood of having a season type in one season ahead. We study this framework by comparing the mean squared errors of forecasts for various settings and various datasets. The best setting is then compared to state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods. We show that it is competitive with them.},

It's value comes with the ability to extract meaningful patterns that are of economic, societal or scientific relevance. A particular challenge is to identify patterns across time, including patterns that might only become apparent when the temporal dimension is taken into account. Here, we present a novel method that aims to achieve this by detecting dynamic clusters, i.e. structural elements that can be present over prolonged durations. It is based on an adaptive identification of majority overlaps between groups at different time points and allows the accommodation of transient decompositions in otherwise persistent dynamic clusters. As such, our method enables the detection of persistent structural elements with internal dynamics and can be applied to any classifiable data, ranging from social contact networks to arbitrary sets of time stamped feature vectors. It provides a unique tool to study systems with non-trivial temporal dynamics with a broad applicability to scientific, societal and economic data.},

  abstract       = {We propose a general statistical framework for clustering multiple time series that exhibit nonlinear dynamics into an a-priori-unknown number of sub-groups. Our motivation comes from neuroscience, where an important problem is to identify, within a large assembly of neurons, subsets that respond similarly to a stimulus or contingency. Upon modeling the multiple time series as the output of a Dirichlet process mixture of nonlinear state-space models, we derive a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for full Bayesian inference that alternates between sampling cluster assignments and sampling parameter values that form the basis of the clustering. The Metropolis step employs recent innovations in particle-based methods. We apply the framework to clustering time series acquired from the prefrontal cortex of mice in an experiment designed to characterize the neural underpinnings of fear.},

  abstract             = {Large-scale data containing multiple important rare clusters, even at moderately high dimensions, pose challenges for existing clustering methods. To address this issue, we propose a new mixture model called Hidden Markov Model on Variable Blocks (HMM-VB) and a new mode search algorithm called Modal Baum-Welch (MBW) for mode-association clustering. HMM-VB leverages prior information about chain-like dependence among groups of variables to achieve the effect of dimension reduction. In case such a dependence structure is unknown or assumed merely for the sake of parsimonious modeling, we develop a recursive search algorithm based on BIC to optimize the formation of ordered variable blocks. The MBW algorithm ensures the feasibility of clustering via mode association, achieving linear complexity in terms of the number of variable blocks despite the exponentially growing number of possible state sequences in HMM-VB. In addition, we provide theoretical investigations about the identifiability of HMM-VB as well as the consistency of our approach to search for the block partition of variables in a special case. Experiments on simulated and real data show that our proposed method outperforms other widely used methods.},

The adopted procedure claims the feature of producing a partition of funds that are readily interpretable from a financial point of view and it is further possible to rank the identified groups, thus obtaining a rating of funds that turns out to account for different propensities toward the risk exposure.},

The proposed method, namely, the MMCC method, aims to achieve high approximation accuracy and computational efficiency by combining an improved moment-matching (MM) method with the clustering (C) method and the Cholesky decomposition (CD) method. First, the C method is used to reduce the number of OSs by minimising the space distance between the reduced scenarios (RSs) and the OSs. Next, the CD method is used to rectify the correlation of the RSs to satisfy that of the ODPD. Finally, the RS probabilities are optimally determined by the MM method in order to minimise the stochastic features (first four moments and correlation matrix) between the RDPD and the ODPD. Simulations of RDPD approximation for three wind farms with 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 scenarios were carried out using the Latin hypercube sampling, importance sampling, C, moment-matching-clustering (MMC), and MMCC methods. The results showed that the MMCC method exhibits the best performance in terms of capturing the features of the ODPD.},

In our new portfolio strategy, central, peripheral and dispersed portfolios constructed from clusters detected using unweighted and weighted modularity are compared according to their past performances, and the optimal portfolio is used in the investment period only if the market index return predicted by the LR, WMA or BP models is positive to avoid losses when the market drops. Our strategy is tested using the daily data of Chinese A-share market from January 4, 2008 and December 31, 2016, and the average investment return during different moving investment periods and 200 repeated runs is calculated. We find that although incorporating dispersed portfolio into our strategy has no significant effect in raising the investment return, it shows a similar performance as the peripheral portfolio, and the strategy constructed using unweighted modularity generally outperforms its counterpart by using weighted modularity. In addition, the market trend prediction can refine the investment return of our strategy. In brief, the strategy constructed using the BP model and unweighted modularity has the best investment return, which also outperforms the Markowitz portfolio.},

In this method, we first construct a hypothetical potential field of all the data points, and show that this potential field is closely related to nonparametric estimation of the global probability density function of the data points. Then we propose a new similarity metric incorporating both the potential field which represents global data distribution information and the distance matrix which represents local data distribution information. Finally we develop another equivalent similarity metric based on an edge weighted tree of all the data points, which leads to a fast agglomerative clustering algorithm with time complexity O(N2). The proposed PHA method is evaluated by comparing with six other typical agglomerative clustering methods on four synthetic data sets and two real data sets. Experiments show that it runs much faster than the other methods and produces the most satisfying results in most cases. A potential field is used to represent global data distribution information. Both local and global data distribution information are used in the clustering. Designed an efficient hierarchical clustering method based on an edge-weighted tree. The potential field can be viewed as an estimated probability density function. PHA usually produces more satisfying results in much less time than other methods.},

Hierarchical clustering algorithms are deterministic, stable, and do not need a pre-determined number of clusters as input. However, they are not scalable for very large data due to their non-linear complexity. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to reduce the complexity of Hierarchical Clustering, improve the purity of the clustering algorithm, and reduce the chaining factor. The proposed method has the following components: (i) A new combination similarity based on common-neighbours of graph theory is proposed, (ii) In every iteration, instead of calculating the centroids for new clusters, new centroids are estimated from centroids in previous iteration, and (iii) In each iteration, instead of merging only one pair of objects, multiple pairs are merged at the same time. In addition to the proposed combination similarity, four well-known methods including centroid-based, group-based, complete-link, and single-link, have been also implemented. All five methods are tested and evaluated using two metrics: purity and imbalance or chaining factor. We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other classic methods.},

  abstract       = {Variable selection in cluster analysis is important yet challenging. It can be achieved by regularization methods, which realize a trade-off between the clustering accuracy and the number of selected variables by using a lasso-type penalty. However, the calibration of the penalty term can suffer from criticisms. Model selection methods are an efficient alternative, yet they require a difficult optimization of an information criterion which involves combinatorial problems. First, most of these optimization algorithms are based on a suboptimal procedure (e.g. stepwise method). Second, the algorithms are often computationally expensive because they need multiple calls of EM algorithms. Here we propose to use a new information criterion based on the integrated complete-data likelihood. It does not require the maximum likelihood estimate and its maximization appears to be simple and computationally efficient. The original contribution of our approach is to perform the model selection without requiring any parameter estimation. Then, parameter inference is needed only for the unique selected model. This approach is used for the variable selection of a Gaussian mixture model with conditional independence assumed. The numerical experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets show that the proposed method often outperforms two classical approaches for variable selection. The proposed approach is implemented in the R package VarSelLCM available on CRAN.},

This workshop brought several experts in pure and applied mathematics together with applied researchers from medical imaging, radar signal processing and finance. The authors belong to the latter group. This document was written as a long introduction to further development of geometric tools in financial applications such as risk or portfolio analysis. Indeed, risk and portfolio analysis essentially rely on covariance matrices. Besides that the Gaussian assumption is known to be inaccurate, covariance matrices are difficult to estimate from empirical data. To filter noise from the empirical estimate, Mantegna proposed using hierarchical clustering. In this work, we first show that this procedure is statistically consistent. Then, we propose to use clustering with a much broader application than the filtering of empirical covariance matrices from the estimate correlation coefficients. To be able to do that, we need to obtain distances between the financial time series that incorporate all the available information in these cross-dependent random processes.},

It was written for a workshop on information geometry and its application for image and signal processing. This workshop brought several experts in pure and applied mathematics together with applied researchers from medical imaging, radar signal processing and finance. The authors belong to the latter group. This document was written as a long introduction to further development of geometric tools in financial applications such as risk or portfolio analysis. Indeed, risk and portfolio analysis essentially rely on covariance matrices. Besides that the Gaussian assumption is known to be inaccurate, covariance matrices are difficult to estimate from empirical data. To filter noise from the empirical estimate, Mantegna proposed using hierarchical clustering. In this work, we first show that this procedure is statistically consistent. Then, we propose to use clustering with a much broader application than the filtering of empirical covariance matrices from the estimated correlation coefficients. To be able to do that, we need to obtain distances between the financial time series that incorporate all the available information in these cross-dependent random processes.},

One key component in cluster analysis is determining a proper dissimilarity measure between two data objects, and many criteria have been proposed in the literature to assess dissimilarity between two time series. The R package TSclust is aimed to implement a large set of well-established peer-reviewed time series dissimilarity measures, including measures based on raw data, extracted features, underlying parametric models, complexity levels, and forecast behaviors. Computation of these measures allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the clustering context. The main features of TSclust are described and examples of its use are presented.},

This paper first reviews existing methods for selecting the number of clusters for the algorithm. Factors that affect this selection are then discussed and an improvement of the existing k-means algorithm to assist the selection is proposed. The paper concludes with an analysis of the results of using cluster validation referring to some measures that are classified as internal and external indexes to determine the optimal number of clusters for the K-means algorithm. There are applied some stopping criterion referring to those indexes for evaluating a clustering against a gold standard.},

The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of MoAR models requires evaluating products of large numbers of densities of normal random variables. In practical scenarios, these products converge to zero as the length of the time series increases, and thus the ML estimation of MoAR models becomes infeasible without the use of numerical tricks. We propose a maximum pseudolikelihood (MPL) estimation approach as an alternative to the use of numerical tricks. The MPL estimator is proved to be consistent and can be computed with an EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm. Simulations are used to assess the performance of the MPL estimator against that of the ML estimator in cases where the latter was able to be calculated. An application to the clustering of time series data arising from a resting state fMRI experiment is presented as a demonstration of the methodology.},

The correlation dimensions in the financial market are calculated and used as a measure to study the cluster structure in the correlation coefficient matrix. First, based on the existing model, we present a toy model. Using the model-generated data, we find that the clearer cluster structure corresponds to a smaller dimension. It implies that the correlation dimension can be used as a measure of the cluster structure in the correlation coefficient matrix. Finally, we use the algorithm to compute the clusters in the real market and verify the previous empirical evidence.

In order to reveal the hidden meaning of these anomalous eigenvalues, we study the toy model with cluster structure and find that these eigenvalues are related to the cluster structure of the correlation coefficient matrix. In this paper, model-based experiments show that in most cases, the number of anomalous eigenvalues of the correlation matrix is equal to the number of clusters. In addition, empirical studies show that the sum of the anomalous eigenvalues is related to the clarity of the cluster structure and is negatively correlated with the correlation dimension.},

We find that volatility clustering is highly nonlinear and strongly asymmetric. Our paper is the first one that models and finds asymmetric nonlinear volatility clustering. This finding is important in asset pricing, derivatives pricing, and risk management. Volatility clustering is a well-known stylized feature of financial asset returns. This paper investigates asymmetric pattern in volatility clustering by employing a univariate copula approach of Chen and Fan (2006). Using daily realized kernel volatilities constructed from high frequency data from stock and foreign exchange markets, we find evidence that volatility clustering is highly nonlinear and strongly asymmetric in that clusters of high volatility occur more often than clusters of low volatility. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to address and uncover this phenomenon. In particular, the asymmetry in volatility clustering is found to be more pronounced in the stock markets than in the foreign exchange markets. Further, the volatility clusters are shown to remain persistent for over a month and asymmetric across different time periods. Our findings have important implications for risk management. A simulation study indicates that models which accommodate asymmetric volatility clustering can significantly improve the out-of-sample forecasts of Value-at-Risk},

The risk is generally linked to the volatility of the asset, but its level of predictability also plays a basic role in investment decisions. In particular, the classification of a certain asset could be linked to its dependence on the volatility of a dominant market: movements in the volatility of the dominant market can provide similar movements in the volatility of the asset and its predictability would depend on the strength of this dependence. Working in a model based framework, we base the classification of the volatility of an asset not only on its volatility level, but also on the presence of spillover effects from a dominant market, such as the US one, and on the similarity of the dynamics of the asset and the dominant market. The method is carried out using an extended version of the Multiplicative Error Model and is applied to a set of European assets, also performing a historical simulation experiment.},

The used data is the daily close price of 175 assets in Indonesian exchange (IDX). We perform 4 clustering algorithms to locate the assets that have the same similarity into the same cluster. Since the four features are being considered, the spherical-shape of data is difficult to observe. In fact, the portfolio return of all algorithm's outcome show the Agglomerative and DBScan algorithm yield higher performance evaluation with no dominant asset included. Assets representatives from each cluster are determined to be in the portfolio formation. By using the portfolio theory by Markowitz, i.e Mean-variance optimization (MVO) and Sharp ration optimization, the proportion of contained assets are computed, and we test their performance by applying the formation into the market data a month after as a testing data.

  abstract             = {The proliferation and ubiquity of temporal data across many disciplines has generated substantial interest in the analysis and mining of time series. Clustering is one of the most popular data-mining methods, not only due to its exploratory power but also because it is often a preprocessing step or subroutine for other techniques. In this article, we present k-Shape and k-MultiShapes (k-MS), two novel algorithms for time-series clustering. k-Shape and k-MS rely on a scalable iterative refinement procedure. As their distance measure, k-Shape and k-MS use shape-based distance (SBD), a normalized version of the cross-correlation measure, to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based on the properties of SBD, we develop two new methods, namely ShapeExtraction (SE) and MultiShapesExtraction (MSE), to compute cluster centroids that are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series to clusters. k-Shape relies on SE to compute a single centroid per cluster based on all time series in each cluster. In contrast, k-MS relies on MSE to compute multiple centroids per cluster to account for the proximity and spatial distribution of time series in each cluster. To demonstrate the robustness of SBD, k-Shape, and k-MS, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation on 85 datasets against state-of-the-art distance measures and clustering methods for time series using rigorous statistical analysis. SBD, our efficient and parameter-free distance measure, achieves similar accuracy to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a highly accurate but computationally expensive distance measure that requires parameter tuning. For clustering, we compare k-Shape and k-MS against scalable and non-scalable partitional, hierarchical, spectral, density-based, and shapelet-based methods, with combinations of the most competitive distance measures. k-Shape outperforms all scalable methods in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, k-Shape also outperforms all non-scalable approaches, with one exception, namely k-medoids with DTW, which achieves similar accuracy. However, unlike k-Shape, this approach requires tuning of its distance measure and is significantly slower than k-Shape. k-MS performs similarly to k-Shape in comparison to rival methods, but k-MS is significantly more accurate than k-Shape. Beyond clustering, we demonstrate the effectiveness of k-Shape to reduce the search space of one-nearest-neighbor classifiers for time series. Overall, SBD, k-Shape, and k-MS emerge as domain-independent, highly accurate, and efficient methods for time-series comparison and clustering with broad applications.},

  abstract       = {The only input to attain the portfolio weights of global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP) is the covariance matrix of returns of assets being considered for investment. Since the population covariance matrix is not known, investors use historical data to estimate it. Even though sample covariance matrix is an unbiased estimator of the population covariance matrix, it includes a great amount of estimation error especially when the number of observed data is not much bigger than number of assets. As it is difficult to estimate the covariance matrix with high dimensionality all at once, clustering stocks is proposed to come up with covariance matrix in two steps: firstly, within a cluster and secondly, between clusters. It decreases the estimation error by reducing the number of features in the data matrix. The motivation of this dissertation is that the estimation error can still remain high even after clustering, if a large amount of stocks is clustered together in a single group. This research proposes to utilize a bounded clustering method in order to limit the maximum cluster size. The result of experiments shows that not only the gap between in-sample volatility and out-of-sample volatility decreases, but also the out-of-sample volatility gets reduced. It implies that we need a bounded clustering algorithm so that maximum clustering size can be precisely controlled to find the best portfolio performance.},

Different approaches could be adopted to tackle the classification problem: statistical tools may contribute to increase the degree of confidence in the classification scheme. A classification algorithm for mutual funds style analysis is proposed, which combines different statistical techniques and exploits information readily available at low cost. Objective, representative, consistent and empirically testable classification schemes are strongly sought for in this field in order to give reliable information to investors and fund managers who are interested in evaluating and comparing different financial products. Institutional classification schemes, when available, do not always provide consistent and representative peer groups of funds. A "return-based"classification scheme is proposed, which aims at identifying mutual funds' styles by analysing time series of past returns. The proposed classification procedure consists of three basic steps: (a) a dimensionality reduction step based on principal component analysis, (b) a clustering step that exploits a robust evolutionary clustering methodology, and (c) a style identification step via a constrained regression model first proposed by William Sharpe. The algorithm is tested on a sample of Italian mutual funds and achieves satisfactory results with respect to (i) the agreement with the existing institutional classification and (ii) the explanatory power of out of sample variability in the cross-section of returns.},

  abstract             = {This article proposes a hierarchical clustering-based asset allocation method, which uses graph theory and machine learning techniques. Hierarchical clustering refers to the formation of a recursive clustering, suggested by the data, not defined a priori. Several hierarchical clustering methods are presented and tested. Once the assets are hierarchically clustered, the authors compute a simple and efficient capital allocation within and across clusters of assets, so that many correlated assets receive the same total allocation as a single uncorrelated one. The out-of-sample performances of hierarchical clustering-based portfolios and more traditional risk-based portfolios are evaluated across three disparate datasets, which differ in term of the number of assets and the assets' composition. To avoid data snooping, the authors assess the comparison of profit measures using the bootstrap-based model confidence set procedure. Their empirical results indicate that hierarchical clustering-based portfolios are robust and truly diversified and achieve statistically better risk-adjusted performances than commonly used portfolio optimization techniques.},

Bayesian posterior samples for the latent allocation variables can be effectively obtained in a wide range of clustering models, including finite mixtures, infinite mixtures, hidden Markov models and block models for networks. However, due to the categorical nature of the clustering variables and the lack of scalable algorithms, summary tools that can interpret such samples are not available. We adopt a Bayesian decision theoretical approach to define an optimality criterion for clusterings and propose a fast and context-independent greedy algorithm to find the best allocations. One important facet of our approach is that the optimal number of groups is automatically selected, thereby solving the clustering and the model-choice problems at the same time. We consider several loss functions to compare partitions and show that our approach can accommodate a wide range of cases. Finally, we illustrate our approach on both artificial and real datasets for three different clustering models: Gaussian mixtures, stochastic block models and latent block models for networks.},

  abstract             = {The problem of portfolio optimization is one of the most important issues in asset management. We here propose a new dynamic portfolio strategy based on the time-varying structures of MST networks in Chinese stock markets, where the market condition is further considered when using the optimal portfolios for investment. A portfolio strategy comprises two stages: First, select the portfolios by choosing central and peripheral stocks in the selection horizon using five topological parameters, namely degree, betweenness centrality, distance on degree criterion, distance on correlation criterion and distance on distance criterion. Second, use the portfolios for investment in the investment horizon. The optimal portfolio is chosen by comparing central and peripheral portfolios under different combinations of market conditions in the selection and investment horizons. Market conditions in our paper are identified by the ratios of the number of trading days with rising index to the total number of trading days, or the sum of the amplitudes of the trading days with rising index to the sum of the amplitudes of the total trading days. We find that central portfolios outperform peripheral portfolios when the market is under a drawup condition, or when the market is stable or drawup in the selection horizon and is under a stable condition in the investment horizon. We also find that peripheral portfolios gain more than central portfolios when the market is stable in the selection horizon and is drawdown in the investment horizon. Empirical tests are carried out based on the optimal portfolio strategy. Among all possible optimal portfolio strategies based on different parameters to select portfolios and different criteria to identify market conditions, 65 percent of our optimal portfolio strategies outperform the random strategy for the Shanghai A-Share market while the proportion is 70 percent for the Shenzhen A-Share market.},

The OpenEnsembles library provides a unified interface for applying transformations to data, clustering data, visualizing individual clustering solutions, visualizing and finishing the ensemble, and calculating validation metrics for a clustering solution for any given partitioning of the data. We have documented examples of using OpenEnsembles to create, analyze, and visualize a number of different types of ensemble approaches on toy and example datasets.

Specifically, we consider a stock portfolio which contains companies from different industrial sectors, located in several different countries. Both sector membership and geography combine to create a complex clustering structure where companies seem to first be divided based on sector, with geographical subclusters emerging within each industrial sector. We argue that standard techniques for detecting overlapping clusters and communities are not able to capture this type of structure, and show how robust regression techniques can instead be used to remove the influence of both sector and geography from the correlation matrix separately. Our analysis reveals that prior to the 2008 financial crisis, companies did not tend to form clusters based on geography. This changed immediately following the crisis, with geography becoming a more important determinant of clustering.},

  abstract             = {We study the cost function for hierarchical clusterings introduced by (Dasgupta, 2016) where hierarchies are treated as first-class objects rather than deriving their cost from projections into flat clusters. It was also shown in (Dasgupta, 2016) that a top-down algorithm based on the uniform Sparsest Cut problem returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most O(alpha n log n)O(alpha n log n) times the cost of the optimal hierarchical clustering, where alpha is the approximation ratio of the Sparsest Cut subroutine used. Thus using the best known approximation algorithm for Sparsest Cut due to Arora-Rao- Vazirani, the top-down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most O(log 3/2n)O(log 3/2n) times the cost of the optimal solution. We improve this by giving an O(log n)O(log n))-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our main technical ingredients are a combinatorial characterization of ultrametrics induced by this cost function, deriving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for this family of ultrametrics, and showing how to iteratively round an LP relaxation of this formulation by using the idea of sphere growing which has been extensively used in the context of graph partitioning. We also prove that our algorithm returns an O(log n)O(log n)- approximate hierarchical clustering for a generalization of this cost function also studied in (Dasgupta, 2016). Experiments show that the hierarchies found by using the ILP formulation as well as our rounding algorithm often have better projections into flat clusters than the standard linkage based algorithms. We conclude with constant factor inapproximability results for this problem: 1) no polynomial size LP or SDP can achieve a constant factor approximation for this problem and 2) no polynomial time algorithm can achieve a constant factor approximation under the Small Set Expansion hypothesis.},

Time-series clustering is no exception, with the Dynamic Time Warping distance being particularly popular in that context. This distance is computationally expensive, so many related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript, a general overview of time-series clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and other recently proposed techniques.

If more than one performance measure is used to evaluate multiple clustering partitions, an optimal result is often difficult to determine by visual inspection alone. This paper introduces optCluster, an R package that uses a single function to simultaneously compare numerous clustering partitions (created by different algorithms and/or numbers of clusters) and obtain a "best" option for a given dataset. The method of weighted rank aggregation is utilized by this package to objectively aggregate various performance measure scores, thereby taking away the guesswork that often follows a visual inspection of cluster results. The optCluster package contains biological validation measures as well as clustering algorithms developed specifically for RNA sequencing data, making it a useful tool for clustering genomic data.},

This is particularly useful to determine if a subset of the variables, e.g. genes in a specific pathway, alone can separate samples into these established classes. Despite this, the evaluation of class separations is often subjective and performed via visualization. Here we present the ClusterSignificance package; a set of tools designed to assess the statistical significance of class separations downstream of dimensionality reduction algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate the design and utility of the ClusterSignificance package and utilize it to determine the importance of long non-coding RNA expression in the identity of multiple hematological malignancies.

Due to the personalized nature of document clustering, even the best fully automatic algorithms cannot create clusters that accurately reflect the user's perspectives. To incorporate the users perspective in the clustering process and, at the same time, effectively visualize document collections to enhance user's sense-making of data, we propose a novel visual analytics system for interactive document clustering. We built our system on top of clustering algorithms that can adapt to user's feedback. First, the initial clustering is created based on the user-defined number of clusters and the selected clustering algorithm. Second, the clustering result is visualized to the user. A collection of coordinated visualization modules and document projection is designed to guide the user towards a better insight into the document collection and clusters. The user changes clusters and key-terms iteratively as a feedback to the clustering algorithm until the result is satisfactory. In key-term based interaction, the user assigns a set of key-terms to each target cluster to guide the clustering algorithm. A set of quantitative experiments, a use case, and a user study have been conducted to show the advantages of the approach for document analytics based on clustering.},

For a planar embedding, this method provides both the intra-cluster hierarchy, which describes the way clusters are composed, and the inter-cluster hierarchy which describes how clusters gather together. We discuss performance, robustness and reliability of this method by first investigating several artificial data-sets, finding that it can outperform significantly other established approaches. Then we show that our method can successfully differentiate meaningful clusters and hierarchies in a variety of real data-sets. In particular, we find that the application to gene expression patterns of lymphoma samples uncovers biologically significant groups of genes which play key-roles in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of some of the most relevant human lymphoid malignancies.},

To estimate the proposed model, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are adopted. Two efficient sampling schemes for drawing discrete indicators are also developed. Simulations show that these efficient sampling schemes can lead to substantial savings in computation time in Monte Carlo procedures involving discrete indicators.

Empirical examples using stock market and exchange rate data are presented in which two-cluster and three-cluster models are selected using posterior probabilities. This implies that the conditional correlation equation is likely to be governed by more than one set of decaying parameters.},

In particular, given two models from the same parametric family of distributions, one can define the distance between these models as the length of the shortest geodesic connecting them in a Riemannian manifold whose metric is given by the model Fisher Information matrix. One limitation that had hinder the adoption of this similarity measure in practical applications is that this distance is typically difficult to compute in a robust manner. We review such complications and provide a general form for the distance function for one parameter models. We next focus on two higher dimensional extreme value models including the Generalized Pareto and Generalized Extreme Value distributions that will be used in financial risk applications. Specifically, we first develop a technique to identify the nearest neighbors of a target security in the sense that their best fit model distributions have minimal Fisher distance to that of target. Second, we develop a hierarchical clustering technique that compares Generalized Extreme Value distributions fit to block maxima of a set of equity loss distributions to group together securities whose worst single day yearly loss distributions exhibit commonalities.},

  abstract       = {A major challenge in cluster analysis is that the number of data clusters is mostly unknown and it must be estimated prior to clustering the observed data. In real-world applications, the observed data is often subject to heavy tailed noise and outliers which obscure the true underlying structure of the data. Consequently, estimating the number of clusters becomes challenging. To this end, we derive a robust cluster enumeration criterion by formulating the problem of estimating the number of clusters as maximization of the posterior probability of multivariate t candidate models. We utilize Bayes' theorem and asymptotic approximations to come up with a robust criterion that possesses a closed-form expression. Further, we refine the derivation and provide a robust cluster enumeration criterion for the finite sample regime. The robust criteria require an estimate of cluster parameters for each candidate model as an input. Hence, we propose a two-step cluster enumeration algorithm that uses the expectation maximization algorithm to partition the data and estimate cluster parameters prior to the calculation of one of the robust criteria. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested and compared to existing cluster enumeration methods using numerical and real data experiments.},

Here we propose Cross-clustering (CC), a partial clustering algorithm that overcomes these four limitations by combining the principles of two well established hierarchical clustering algorithms: Ward's minimum variance and Complete-linkage. We validated CC by comparing it with a number of existing clustering methods, including Ward's and Complete-linkage. We show on both simulated and real datasets, that CC performs better than the other methods in terms of: the identification of the correct number of clusters, the identification of outliers, and the determination of real cluster memberships. We used CC to cluster samples in order to identify disease subtypes, and on gene profiles, in order to determine groups of genes with the same behavior. Results obtained on a non-biological dataset show that the method is general enough to be successfully used in such diverse applications. The algorithm has been implemented in the statistical language R and is freely available from the CRAN contributed packages repository.},

The predicted and realized risk level and the relative portfolio composition of the selected portfolio for a given value of the portfolio return are also investigated for each considered filtering method.

The problem gets more challenging if we consider the multivariate TS. In the field of Business and Management, multivariate TS are becoming more and more interesting as they allow to match events the co-occur in time but that is hardly noticeable. In this study, Recurrent Neural Networks and transfer learning have been used to analyze each example, measuring similarities between variables. All the results are finally aggregated to create an adjacency matrix that allows extracting the groups.

In this paper we explore how to solve the correlation clustering objective exactly when the data to be clustered can be represented by a low-rank matrix. We prove in particular that correlation clustering can be solved in polynomial time when the underlying matrix is positive semidefinite with small constant rank, but that the task remains NP-hard in the presence of even one negative eigenvalue. Based on our theoretical results, we develop an algorithm for efficiently ``solving'' low-rank positive semidefinite correlation clustering by employing a procedure for zonotope vertex enumeration. We demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of our algorithm by using it to solve several clustering problems on both synthetic and real-world data.},

We use the factor model to study how the log volatility contributes to volatility clustering, quantifying the strength of the volatility clustering using a new nonparametric integrated proxy. Indeed finding a link between volatility and volatility clustering, we find that a global analysis reveals that only the market contributes to the volatility clustering. A local analysis reveals that for some clusters, the cluster itself contributes statistically to the volatility clustering effect. This is significantly advantageous over other factor models, since it offers a way of selecting factors in a statistical way, whilst also keeping economically relevant factors. Finally, we show that the log volatility factor model explains a similar amount of memory to a principal components analysis factor model and an exploratory factor model.},

We find the respective coefficients of determination (R2)(R2) are close for DT models, while finding an advantage to NNS in ST and large sample cases. Regression coefficients are sometimes regarded as approximations to partial derivatives, especially in social sciences. Then, NNS alone has the ability to compute a range of partials evaluated at points within the sample and also out-of-sample.

NNS clustering is a method of partitioning the joint distribution into partial moment quadrants (clustering), and assigning identifiers to observations (classification). NNS clustering is very similar to k-means clustering, and we direct the reader to Vinod and Viole [2016] for a proof and comparison between the methods. This article is intended to present working examples of several classification problems using NNS clustering analysis.

We demonstrate how NNS clustering is quite effective, as well as an alternative method NNS employs for classification tasks. We compare predictions of test sets with NNS, k-means using the "cl.predict" routine offered in R to "predict class ids or memberships from R objects representing partitions", K nearest neighbors classification using the "knn" routine in R-package "class", and a naive Bayes classification using the "e1071" package.

The methods and results presented immediately raise suspicions on the pervasive notion of dimension reduction given the consistent performance of the NNS Multivariate Regression.},

Each series within a cluster is assumed to follow the same model and the data are then pooled for estimation. The classification is model-based and robust to outlier contamination. The robustness is achieved by using the intrinsic mode functions of the Hilbert-Huang transform at lower frequencies.

These functions are found to be robust to outlier contamination. The paper also compares out-of-sample forecast performance of the proposed method with several methods available in the literature. The other forecasting methods considered include vector autoregressive models with or without LASSO, group LASSO, principal component regression, and partial least squares.

The proposed method is found to perform well in out-of-sample forecasting of the monthly unemployment rates of 50 US states.},

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Cluster analysis is the most common unsupervised method for finding hidden groups in data. Clustering presents two main challenges: (1) finding the optimal number of clusters, and (2) removing "outliers" among the objects being clustered. Few clustering algorithms currently deal directly with the outlier problem. Furthermore, existing methods for identifying the number of clusters still have some drawbacks. Thus, there is a need for a better algorithm to tackle both challenges. RESULTS: We present a new approach, implemented in an R package called Thresher, to cluster objects in general datasets. Thresher combines ideas from principal component analysis, outlier filtering, and von Mises-Fisher mixture models in order to select the optimal number of clusters. We performed a large Monte Carlo simulation study to compare Thresher with other methods for detecting outliers and determining the number of clusters. We found that Thresher had good sensitivity and specificity for detecting and removing outliers. We also found that Thresher is the best method for estimating the optimal number of clusters when the number of objects being clustered is smaller than the number of variables used for clustering. Finally, we applied Thresher and eleven other methods to 25 sets of breast cancer data downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus; only Thresher consistently estimated the number of clusters to lie in the range of 4-7 that is consistent with the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Thresher is effective at automatically detecting and removing outliers. By thus cleaning the data, it produces better estimates of the optimal number of clusters when there are more variables than objects. When we applied Thresher to a variety of breast cancer datasets, it produced estimates that were both self-consistent and consistent with the literature. We expect Thresher to be useful for studying a wide variety of biological datasets.},

Despite these advantages, convex clustering has not been widely adopted, due to its computationally intensive nature and its lack of compelling visualizations. To address these impediments, we introduce Algorithmic Regularization, an innovative technique for obtaining high-quality estimates of regularization paths using an iterative one-step approximation scheme. We justify our approach with a novel theoretical result, guaranteeing global convergence of the approximate path to the exact solution under easily-checked non-data-dependent assumptions. The application of algorithmic regularization to convex clustering yields the Convex Clustering via Algorithmic Regularization Paths (CARP) algorithm for computing the clustering solution path. On example data sets from genomics and text analysis, CARP delivers over a 100-fold speed-up over existing methods, while attaining a finer approximation grid than standard methods. Furthermore, CARP enables improved visualization of clustering solutions: the fine solution grid returned by CARP can be used to construct a convex clustering-based dendrogram, as well as forming the basis of a dynamic path-wise visualization based on modern web technologies. Our methods are implemented in the open-source R package clustRviz, available at this https URL.},

This implies series are grouped together at a given time if there is evidence the most recent shifts in their respective volatilities were coincident or closely timed.

One of the drawbacks is that the estimated parameters may be deviated from the actual ones. Therefore, robustness is considered so as to cope with the issue of parameter inaccuracy. In view of this, we propose a clustered scenario-tree approach, which accommodates the parameter inaccuracy problem in the context of a scenario tree. Proposed a new kind of scenario tree, called ? cluster tree ?. It accommodates the parameter inaccuracy in the context of a scenario tree. The idea is illustrated with portfolio selection problems.

However, local patterns, which are composed of partial data points, are usually obscured by noises and missed in traditional quality measure approaches that measure the whole dataset. In this paper, we propose an interactive interface to explore 2D linear projections with visual patterns on subsets. First, we propose a voting-based algorithm to recommend optimal projection, in which the identified pattern looks the most salient. Specifically, we propose three kinds of point-wise quality metrics of 2D linear projections for outliers, clusterings, and trends, respectively. For each sampled projection, we measure its importance by accumulating the metrics of selected points. The projection with the highest importance is recommended. Second, we design an exploring interface with a scatterplot, a projection trail map, and a control panel. Our interface allows users to explore projections by specifying interested data subsets. At last, we employ three datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three case studies of exploring clusters, outliers, and trends.},

  abstract             = {Semi-supervised clustering seeks to augment traditional clustering methods by incorporating side information provided via human expertise in order to increase the semantic meaningfulness of the resulting clusters. However, most current methods are passive in the sense that the side information is provided beforehand and selected randomly. This may require a large number of constraints, some of which could be redundant, unnecessary, or even detrimental to the clustering results. Thus in order to scale such semi-supervised algorithms to larger problems it is desirable to pursue an active clustering method, i.e., an algorithm that maximizes the effectiveness of the available human labor by only requesting human input where it will have the greatest impact. Here, we propose a novel online framework for active semi-supervised spectral clustering that selects pairwise constraints as clustering proceeds, based on the principle of uncertainty reduction. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we decompose the expected uncertainty reduction problem into a gradient and a step-scale, computed via an application of matrix perturbation theory and cluster-assignment entropy, respectively. The resulting model is used to estimate the uncertainty reduction potential of each sample in the dataset. We then present the human user with pairwise queries with respect to only the best candidate sample. We evaluate our method using three different image datasets (faces, leaves and dogs), a set of common UCI machine learning datasets and a gene dataset. The results validate our decomposition formulation and show that our method is consistently superior to existing state-of-the-art techniques, as well as being robust to noise and to unknown numbers of clusters.},

  abstract       = {Robo-advisor is a type of financial recommendation that can provide investors with financial advice or investment management online. Data clustering and item recommendation are both important and challenging in Robo-advisor. These two tasks are often considered independently and most efforts have been made to tackle them separately. However, users in data clustering and group relationship in item recommendation are inherently related. For example, a large number of financial transactions include not only the user asset information, but also the user social information. The existence of relations between users and groups motivates us to jointly perform clustering and item recommendation for Robo-advisor in this paper. In particular, we provide a principle way to capture the relations between users and groups, and propose a novel framework CLURE, which fuses data CLUstering and item REcommendation into a coherent model. With experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework CLURE achieves superior performance on both tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper explores an alternative to Lloyd algorithm that retains its simplicity and mitigates its tendency to get trapped by local minima. Called power k-means, our method embeds the k-means problem in a continuous class of similar, better behaved problems with fewer local minima. Power k-means anneals its way toward the solution of ordinary k-means by way of majorization-minimization (MM), sharing the appealing descent property and low complexity of Lloyd algorithm. Further, our method complements widely used seeding strategies, reaping marked improvements when used together as demonstrated on a suite of simulated and real data examples.},

  abstract  = {Industry classification has been rigorously utilized in academic research and business analytics. The existing classification schemes, however, have been constructed and maintained manually by domain experts, which require exhaustive time and human effort while vulnerable to subjectivity. Hence, the existing classification systems do not properly reflect the fast-changing trends of the firms and the capital market. As a remedy to such shortcomings, this paper proposes a new classification scheme, Business Text Industry Classification (BTIC), namely, that automatically clusters securities based on the textual information from the corporate disclosures. BTIC exploits the business section of the Form 10-Ks, in which firms provide their self-identities in a rich context. We employ doc2vec for document embedding and apply Ward's hierarchical clustering method to categorize securities into BTIC groups. Evaluation results using 12 financial ratios commonly found in financial research show that BTIC performs just as good as SIC and GICS in terms of inter- and intra-industry homogeneity, especially for the higher level of clustering. Given that, we claim that BTIC outperforms SIC and GICS in four aspects: process automation, objectivity, clustering flexibility, and result interpretability.},

There are two innovations in this paper. The first one is that the features of the clusters with potential value are embedded into the process of AHC, which reduces the time cost of clustering process. The second one is that we propose two indicators, whole similarity and trend similarity, to measure the persistence of the cluster. The experiment on ten time segments shows the obtained clusters is effective, in which both the whole similarity and the trend similarity on training data are markedly higher than that of randomized clustering. In addition, the persistence of these clusters on test data is also better that the result of randomized guess.

  abstract             = {This thesis investigates volatility clustering, scaling and dynamics in financial series of asset returns and studies the underlying mechanism. We propose a direct measure of volatility clustering based on the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the returns given the return in the previous time interval. We found that the CPDs of returns in real financial time series exhibits universal scaling, characterized by a collapse of the CPDs (of different time lags and of different returns in the previous interval) into to a universal curve exhibiting a power-law tail with an exponent of 4. We construct a simple phenomenological model to explain the emergence of VC and the associated volatility scaling. We also study agent-based models of financial markets, and explore the impact of dynamical risk aversion (DRA) of heterogeneous agents on the price fluctuations. We found that the DRA is the primary driving force responsible for excess price fluctuations and the associated volatility clustering. Both our models (phenomenological model and agent-based model) are able to generate time series that reproduces stylized facts of the market data on different time scales. We have also studied general herding behavior often exhibited in financial markets in the context of an evolutionary Minority Game. We discovered a general mechanism for the transition from segregation into opposing groups to clustering towards cautious behavior.},

In this work, we propose a non-parametric bootstrapping approach to estimating the stability of a clustering method, which also captures stability of the individual clusters and observations. This flexible framework enables different types of comparisons between clusterings and can be used in connection with two possible bootstrap approaches for stability. The first approach, scheme 1, can be used to assess confidence (stability) around clustering from the original dataset based on bootstrap replications. A second approach, scheme 2, searches over the bootstrap clusterings for an optimally stable partitioning of the data. The two schemes accommodate different model assumptions that can be motivated by an investigator trust (or lack thereof) in the original data and additional computational considerations. We propose a hierarchical visualization extrapolated from the stability profiles that give insights into the separation of groups, and projected visualizations for the inspection of the stability of individual operations. Our approaches show good performance in simulation and on real data. These approaches can be implemented using the R package bootcluster that is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).},

We hypothesize that the clustering of the MST reveals insight in the hierarchical structure of weighted graphs. However, existing theories and algorithms have difficulties to define and identify clusters in trees. Here, we first define clustering in trees and then propose a tree agglomerative hierarchical clustering (TAHC) method for the detection of clusters in MSTs. We then demonstrate that the TAHC method can detect clusters in artificial trees, and also in MSTs of weighted social networks, for which the clusters are in agreement with the previously reported clusters of the original weighted networks. Our results therefore not only indicate that clusters can be found in MSTs, but also that the MSTs contain information about the underlying clusters of the original weighted network.},

A choice of KK that correctly characterizes the features of the data is essential for building meaningful clusters. In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the number of clusters in functional data analysis by introducing a new measure that can be used with different procedures in selecting the optimal KK. The main idea is to use a combination of two test statistics, which measure the lack of parallelism and the mean distance between curves, to compute criteria such as the within and between cluster sum of squares. Simulations in challenging scenarios suggest that procedures using this measure can detect the correct number of clusters more frequently than existing methods in the literature. The application of the proposed method is illustrated on several real datasets.},

This paper presents a comprehensive data mining process to forecast the daily direction of the S\&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) return based on 60 financial and economical features. The fuzzy c-means method (FCM) is initially used to cluster the preprocessed data. A principal component analysis (PCA) is applied next to the entire data set and each of seven clusters. The dimension of the entire cleaned data set is then reduced according to the combining results from the entire data set and each cluster. Corresponding to different levels of the dimensionality reduction, twelve new data sets are generated from the entire cleaned data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and logistic regression models are then used with the twelve transformed data sets for classification in order to forecast the daily direction of future market returns and indicate the efficiency of dimensionality reduction with PCA. A group of hypothesis tests are performed over the classification and simulation results to show that the ANNs give significantly higher classification accuracy than logistic regression, and that the trading strategies guided by the comprehensive cluster and classification mining procedure based on PCA and ANNs gain higher risk-adjusted profits than the comparison benchmarks, as well as those strategies guided by the forecasts based on PCA and logistic regression models.},

  abstract       = {This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised clustering which remains one of the most fundamental challenges in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We propose the clustered generator model for clustering which contains both continuous and discrete latent variables. Discrete latent variables model the cluster label while the continuous ones model variations within each cluster. The learning of the model proceeds in a unified probabilistic framework and incorporates the unsupervised clustering as an inner step without the need for an extra inference model as in existing variational-based models. The latent variables learned serve as both observed data embedding or latent representation for data distribution. Our experiments show that the proposed model can achieve competitive unsupervised clustering accuracy and can learn disentangled latent representations to generate realistic samples. In addition, the model can be naturally extended to per-pixel unsupervised clustering which remains largely unexplored.},

To explain this finding, I argue that stocks in more central industries have greater market risk because they have greater exposure to sectoral shocks that transmit from one industry to another through intersectoral trade. Consistent with this argument, stock returns of central industries covary more closely with market returns and future consumption growth. In addition, the empirical evidence suggests that sectoral shocks that contribute to aggregate risk are more likely to pass through central industries than peripheral industries.},

  abstract             = {The heterogeneous nature of a complex network determines the roles of each node in the network that are quite different. Mechanisms of complex networks such as spreading dynamics, cascading reactions, and network synchronization are highly affected by a tiny fraction of so-called important nodes. Node importance ranking is thus of great theoretical and practical significance. Network entropy is usually utilized to characterize the amount of information encoded in the network structure and to measure the structural complexity at the graph level. We find that entropy can also serve as a local level metric to quantify node importance. We propose an entropic metric, Entropy Variation, defining the node importance as the variation of network entropy before and after its removal, according to the assumption that the removal of a more important node is likely to cause more structural variation. Like other state-of-the-art methods for ranking node importance, the proposed entropic metric is also used to utilize structural information, but at the systematical level, not the local level. Empirical investigations on real life networks, the Snake Idioms Network, and several other well-known networks, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed entropic metric, notably outperforming other centrality metrics in identifying the top-k most important nodes.},

Logged first-differences of daily stock prices serve as input for a correlation-based distance measure between any two of the 296 stocks. The computation of a Minimal Spanning Tree then abstracts from a complete network and allows for a topological analysis of the resulting community structure. Both the Great Recession (2007-2008) and the Global Commodity Crisis (2010-2011) reveal tendencies of enhanced community formation compared to a formerly rather randomized network structure. Nevertheless, the drivers of the resulting clustering are found not to be related to industry sector affiliation.},

  abstract       = {Networks are one of the most powerful structures for modeling problems in the real world. Downstream machine learning tasks defined on networks have the potential to solve a variety of problems. With link prediction, for instance, one can predict whether two persons will become friends on a social network. Many machine learning algorithms, however, require that each input example is a real vector. Network embedding encompasses various methods for unsupervised, and sometimes supervised, learning of feature representations of nodes and links in a network. Typically, embedding methods are based on the assumption that the similarity between nodes in the network should be reflected in the learned feature representations. In this paper, we review significant contributions to network embedding in the last decade. In particular, we look at four methods: Spectral Clustering, DeepWalk, Large-scale Information Network Embedding (LINE), and node2vec. We describe each method and list its advantages and shortcomings. In addition, we give examples of real-world machine learning problems on networks in which the embedding is critical in order to maximize the predictive performance of the machine learning task. Finally, we take a look at research trends and state-of-the art methods in the research on network embedding.},

Research has focused on network analysis techniques to understand the extent and nature of such information flow. It is now an established fact that a stock market crash in one country can have a serious impact on other markets across the globe. It follows that such crashes or critical regimes will affect the network dynamics of the global financial markets. In this paper, we use sequential change point detection in dynamic networks to detect changes in the network characteristics of thirteen stock markets across the globe. Our method helps us to detect changes in network behavior across all known stock market crashes during the period of study. In most of the cases, we can detect a change in the network characteristics prior to crash. Our work thus opens the possibility of using this technique to create a warning bell for critical regimes in financial markets.},

This method makes use of information filtering networks to produce a robust estimate of the global sparse inverse covariance from a simple sum of local inverse covariances computed on small subparts of the network. Being based on local and low-dimensional inversions, this method is computationally very efficient and statistically robust, even for the estimation of inverse covariance of high-dimensional, noisy, and short time series. Applied to financial data our method results are computationally more efficient than state-of-the-art methodologies such as Glasso producing, in a fraction of the computation time, models that can have equivalent or better performances but with a sparser inference structure. We also discuss performances with sparse factor models where we notice that relative performances decrease with the number of factors. The local nature of this approach allows us to perform computations in parallel and provides a tool for dynamical adaptation by partial updating when the properties of some variables change without the need of recomputing the whole model. This makes this approach particularly suitable to handle big data sets with large numbers of variables. Examples of practical application for forecasting, stress testing, and risk allocation in financial systems are also provided.},

However, in many applications this assumption is inappropriate due to a network of dependences between units in the data. Methods for estimating causal effects have been developed in the setting where the structure of dependence between units is known exactly, but in practice there is often substantial uncertainty about the precise network structure. This is true, for example, in trial data drawn from vulnerable communities where social ties are difficult to query directly. In this paper we combine techniques from the structure learning and interference literatures in causal inference, proposing a general method for estimating causal effects under data dependence when the structure of this dependence is not known a priori.

This effect is independent of style investing and robust to multiple specifications of holdings similarity. Effects between fund styles provide evidence of crowded trades or 'style drift'. The literature on mutual fund flows documents surprisingly large return effects given that mutual fund flows are uninformed (i.e., not related to fundamentals). I provide evidence that network externalities generate the necessary amplification mechanism to support these results. Network externalities are generated by mutual funds with common holdings and return-chasing investors. Economically, I show that the fund flow network externality is 32-92 percent as large as the typical explanatory effects (e.g., lagged flows). Network externalities generate a 1.5 percent quarterly excess return that reverses in the subsequent year, and are independent of style investing and robust to multiple specifications of holdings similarity.},

The considered approach is based on the weighted market graph model, which is used for identifying clusters of stocks according to a correlation-based criterion. The proposed techniques provide a new framework for selecting profitable diversified portfolios, which is verified by computational experiments on historical data over the past decade. In addition, the proposed approach can be used as a complementary tool for narrowing down a set of - candidate- stocks for a diversified portfolio, which can potentially be analyzed using other known portfolio selection techniques.},

  abstract             = {Identifying key agents for the transmission of diseases (ideas, technology, etc.) across social networks has predominantly relied on measures of centrality on a static base network or a temporally flattened graph of agent interactions. Various measures have been proposed as the best trackers of influence, such as degree centrality, betweenness, and k-shell, depending on the structure of the connectivity. We consider SIR and SIS propagation dynamics on a temporally-extruded network of observed interactions and measure the conditional marginal spread as the change in the magnitude of the infection given the removal of each agent at each time: its temporal knockout (TKO) score. We argue that this TKO score is an effective benchmark measure for evaluating the accuracy of other, often more practical, measures of influence. We find that none of the network measures applied to the induced flat graphs are accurate predictors of network propagation influence on the systems studied; however, temporal networks and the TKO measure provide the requisite targets for the search for effective predictive measures.},

The paper generalizes previous research on stock market networks by including asset returns and volume trading as the main variables to study the financial market. A multidimensional generalization of the minimal spanning tree (MST) concept is introduced, by adding the role of trading volume to the traditional approach which only includes price returns. Additionally, we use symbolization methods to the raw data to study the behavior of the market structure in different, normal and critical, situations. The hierarchical organization of the network is derived, and the MST for different sub-periods of 2002-2014 is created to illustrate how the structure of the market evolves over time. From the structural topologies of these trees, different clusters of companies are identified and analyzed according to their geographical and economic links. Two important results are achieved. Firstly, as other studies have highlighted, at the time of the financial crisis after 2008 the network becomes a more centralized one. Secondly and most important, during our second period of analysis, 2008-2014, we observe that hierarchy becomes more country-specific where different sub-clusters of stocks belonging to France, Germany, Spain or Italy are found apart from their business sector group. This result may suggest that during this period of time financial investors seem to be worried most about country specific economic circumstances.},

This can happen when the existing financial links turn from being a means of risk diversification to channels for the propagation of risk across financial institutions. In this review article, we summarize recent developments in the modeling of financial systemic risk. We focus in particular on network approaches, such as models of default cascades due to bilateral exposures or to overlapping portfolios, and we also report on recent findings on the empirical structure of interbank networks.

In this paper, I show that the local network properties have similar predictive power. I focus on key network measures like average path length, average degree or cluster coefficient, and also consider the diameter and the s-metric. Using Granger causality tests, I show that some of these measures have statistically significant prediction power with respect to the dynamics of aggregate stock market. Average path length is most robust relative to the frequency of data used or specification (index or growth rate). Most measures are found to have predictive power only for monthly frequency. Further evidences that support this view are provided through a simple regression model.},

To address such concerns, various deep learning models, mainly Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based methods, are proposed. Nevertheless, capturing extremely long-term patterns while effectively incorporating information from other variables remains a challenge for time-series forecasting. Furthermore, lack-of-explainability remains one serious drawback for deep neural network models. Inspired by Memory Network proposed for solving the question-answering task, we propose a deep learning based model named Memory Time-series network (MTNet) for time series forecasting. MTNet consists of a large memory component, three separate encoders, and an autoregressive component to train jointly. Additionally, the attention mechanism designed enable MTNet to be highly interpretable. We can easily tell which part of the historic data is referenced the most.},

In this approach, a system of multiple indexes is constructed firstly. Then each evaluation result of an individual index is handled into a discrete distribution. Finally an optimal integrated evaluation solution is obtained by linear programming. This approach has a well-formed theoretic basis and an easily calculated procedure, which can be used in a variety of complex networks.

We formulate and solve all these portfolio allocation problems using both the standard approach and the network-based approach. Moreover, in constructing the network-based portfolios we propose the use of two different estimators for the covariance matrix: the sample estimator and the shrinkage toward constant correlation one. All the strategies under analysis are implemented on two high-dimensional portfolios having different characteristics, covering the period from January 2001 to December 2017. We find that the network-based portfolio consistently better performs and has lower risk compared to the corresponding standard portfolio in an out-of-sample perspective.},

Three different methods are proposed in order to extract the dependence structure between assets in a network context. Starting from this modified structure, we formulate and then we solve the asset allocation problem. We find that the optimal portfolios obtained through a network-based approach are composed mainly of peripheral assets, which are poorly connected with the others. These portfolios, in the majority of cases, are characterized by an higher trade-off between performance and risk with respect to the traditional global minimum variance portfolio. Additionally, this methodology benefits of a graphical visualization of the selected portfolio directly over the graphic layout of the network, which helps in improving our understanding of the optimal strategy.},

RFN models identify rare and small events in the input, have a low interference between code units, have a small reconstruction error, and explain the data covariance structure. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm derived from the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. We proof convergence and correctness of the RFN learning algorithm. On benchmarks, RFNs are compared to other unsupervised methods like autoencoders, RBMs, factor analysis, ICA, and PCA. In contrast to previous sparse coding methods, RFNs yield sparser codes, capture the data's covariance structure more precisely, and have a significantly smaller reconstruction error. We test RFNs as pretraining technique for deep networks on different vision datasets, where RFNs were superior to RBMs and autoencoders. On gene expression data from two pharmaceutical drug discovery studies, RFNs detected small and rare gene modules that revealed highly relevant new biological insights which were so far missed by other unsupervised methods.},

Here we show that, if the number of clusters was known beforehand, standard methods, like modularity optimization, would considerably gain in accuracy, mitigating the severe resolution bias that undermines the reliability of the results of the original unconstrained version. The number of clusters can be inferred from the spectra of the recently introduced nonbacktracking and flow matrices, even in benchmark graphs with realistic community structure. The limit of such a two-step procedure is the overhead of the computation of the spectra.},

The authors identify four desired properties for any systemic risk measure.

Flexibility in choosing explanatory factors to suit the specific objectives of a study makes this methodology useful for portfolio analysis, risk parity approaches, and risk management decisions. We illustrate the features of the methodology for a set of major industry equity indices and to blue chip stocks, where we analyze the dynamic relevance of Fama-French factors. Investigating the network for more than 20 years, including the dot-com bust, global financial crisis, and European debt crisis, helps draw many insights. For instance, unexpected industries are seen to connect idiosyncratically through the dot-com bust. We demonstrate that a network factor model based portfolio allocation performs better than a regular factor model based allocation.},

  abstract       = {Network theory proved recently to be useful in the quantification of many properties of financial systems. The analysis of the structure of investment portfolios is a major application since their eventual correlation and overlap impact the actual risk diversification by individual investors. We investigate the bipartite network of US mutual fund portfolios and their assets. We follow its evolution during the Global Financial Crisis and analyse the interplay between diversification, as understood in classical portfolio theory, and similarity of the investments of different funds. We show that, on average, portfolios have become more diversified and less similar during the crisis. However, we also find that large overlap is far more likely than expected from models of random allocation of investments. This indicates the existence of strong correlations between fund portfolio strategies. We introduce a simplified model of propagation of financial shocks, that we exploit to show that a systemic risk component origins from the similarity of portfolios. The network is still vulnerable after crisis because of this effect, despite the increase in the diversification of portfolios. Our results indicate that diversification may even increase systemic risk when funds diversify in the same way. Diversification and similarity can play antagonistic roles and the trade-off between the two should be taken into account to properly assess systemic risk.},

While studies surrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding of the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In this paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality metrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four widely-used network clustering algorithms-Louvain, Infomap, label propagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality metrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the information recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual information, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes varying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes. We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster quality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4 out of 1 on modularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find conductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best indicates performance on the information recovery metrics. Additionally, our study shows that the variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be assumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information. Smart local moving is the overall best performing algorithm in our study, but discrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it an absolutely superior algorithm. Interestingly, Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the tests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap was superior to Louvain. We find that although label propagation performs poorly when clusters are less clearly defined, it scales efficiently and accurately to large graphs with well-defined clusters.},

In particular, this article introduces a measure of interconnectedness to capture the interrelationship of returns of 100 largest stocks in SandP 500 during 1990-2014. In the financial network literature, the interconnection of a stock network is often regarded as a channel through which an idiosyncratic shock propagates. The idiosyncratic risk propagation is crucial to the debate over the relationship between idiosyncratic risk and market returns because the idiosyncratic risk is not always diversified away. Rather, the network can sometimes amplify the effect of the idiosyncratic risk to cause aggregate fluctuation. In accordance with this theoretical argument, I empirically show that the network topology, measured by diameter, works together with the idiosyncratic risk, measured by average stock variance, to affect the market portfolio returns. This relationship persists after controlling for well-known variables known to forecast the stock market returns.},

Firstly, we present a method to transform a set of time series into a network using different distance functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and, consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series distance functions, network generation methods and community detection techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such as k-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.},

Communities, or clusters, are usually groups of vertices having higher probability of being connected to each other than to members of other groups, though other patterns are possible. Identifying communities is an ill-defined problem. There are no universal protocols on the fundamental ingredients, like the definition of community itself, nor on other crucial issues, like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their performances. This has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions, which undermine the progress in the field. We offer a guided tour through the main aspects of the problem. We also point out strengths and weaknesses of popular methods, and give directions to their use.},

We carry out a simulation study that determines the probability of a systemic crisis in the banking network as a function of both the level of diversification, and the connectivity and structure of the financial network. In contrast to earlier studies we find that diversification at the level of individual banks may be beneficial for financial stability even if it does lead to a higher asset return correlation across banks.},

Consequently, there has been an increasing need for verisimilar financial stress testings, namely simulating and analyzing financial portfolios in extreme, albeit rare scenarios. Unlike conventional risk management which exploits statistical correlations among financial instruments, here we focus our analysis on the notion of probabilistic causation, which is embodied by Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs), SBCNs are probabilistic graphical models that have many attractive features in terms of more accurate causal analysis for generating financial stress scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach for conducting stress testing of financial portfolios based on SBCNs in combination with classical machine learning classification tools. The resulting method is shown to be capable of correctly discovering the causal relationships among financial factors that affect the portfolios and thus, simulating stress testing scenarios with a higher accuracy and lower computational complexity than conventional Monte Carlo Simulations.},

In this paper, we propose {NeuralWarp}, a novel measure that models the alignment of time-series indices in a deep representation space, by modeling a warping function as an upper level neural network between deeply-encoded time series values. Experimental results demonstrate that {NeuralWarp} outperforms both non-parametric and un-warped deep models on a range of diverse real-life datasets.},

  abstract             = {we propose in this work an innovative approach that exploits graphical models in order to provide buy or sell indications on the most capitalized equity market in the world: the SandP500. Adopting a model allows us to deal with a complex framework by generating a reliable approximation of the real world. We decided to analyze the SandP500 because its dynamics are influenced by a large amount of variables whose interpretation represents a challenging task for practitioners. Generally, an investor observes the market and then he makes a decision but procedure is generally time consuming. This is why computers and algorithms are spreading in the last years through financial industry with the objective of supporting fund managers and strategists. The aim of this work is to build a model that is able to perform in a mouse-click simulations on alternative market scenarios by exploiting algorithms potential. In order to do that, we use graphical models: Bayesian Networks (BNs) and their extension called Object Oriented Bayesian Networks (OOBNs). The attribute "graphical" means that they can both be represented by a graph, a feature that makes complex frameworks easier to interpret. Furthermore, thanks to Hugin, a software that has been designed to deal exclusively with these models, we can exploit the potentiality of some algorithms that allow us to learn directly from the data the network structure and to define prior probabilities. Thanks to these features, it is possible to observe known or unexpected dependence/independence relations among the variables and to simulate the impact of new information across the network. In summary, we have chosen BNs and OOBNs because graphical models allow showing clearly and intuitively dependence and independence relations. Moreover, they deal efficiently with uncertain situations by exploiting some of the most established probability theories, such as the Bayes' Rule. Furthermore, by using the Hugin software we can exploit the algorithms implemented in it and learn directly from the data the network structure or simulate in real time different scenarios},

  abstract       = {Stock networks, constructed from stock price time series, are a well-established tool for the characterization of complex behavior in stock markets. Following Mantegna's seminal paper, the linear Pearson's correlation coefficient between pairs of stocks has been the usual way to determine network edges. Recently, possible effects of nonlinearity on the graph-theoretical properties of such networks have been demonstrated when using nonlinear measures such as mutual information instead of linear correlation. In this paper, we quantitatively characterize the nonlinearity in stock time series and the effect it has on stock network properties. This is achieved by a systematic multi-step approach that allows us to quantify the nonlinearity of coupling; correct its effects wherever it is caused by simple univariate non-Gaussianity; potentially localize in space and time any remaining strong sources of this nonlinearity; and, finally, study the effect nonlinearity has on global network properties. By applying this multi-step approach to stocks included in three prominent indices (New York Stock Exchange 100, Financial Times Stock Exchange 100, and Standard and Poor 500), we establish that the apparent nonlinearity that has been observed is largely due to univariate non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, strong nonstationarity in a few specific stocks may play a role. In particular, the sharp decrease in some stocks during the global financial crisis of 2008 gives rise to apparent nonlinear dependencies among stocks.},

Relying only on publicly available daily market data, we determine time-varying systemic risk networks, and forecast the systemic relevance on a quarterly basis.

We use a comprehensive data set consisting of Standard and Poor's 500 corporations from January 1988 until October 2016. The final model forecasts correctly all major recession and prosperity phases of the U.S. economy up to one year ahead. By employing different network measures on the level of corporations, we can also identify which companies' stocks possess a key role in a changing economic environment and may be used as indication of critical (and prosperous) developments. More generally, the proposed approach allows to predict probabilities for different overall states of social entities by using local network positions and could be applied on various phenomena.},

In this work, we fill this gap in the literature by introducing the first framework for local community detection in multilayer networks (ML-LCD). We formalize the ML-LCD optimization problem and provide three definitions of the associated objective function, which correspond to different ways to incorporate within-layer and across-layer topological features. We also exploit our framework to generate multilayer global community structures. We conduct an extensive experimentation using seven real-world multilayer networks, which also includes comparison with state-of-the-art methods for single-layer local community detection and for multilayer global community detection. Results show the significance of our proposed methods in discovering local communities over multiple layers, and also highlight their ability in producing global community structures that are better in modularity than those produced by native global community detection approaches.},

  abstract       = {The recent global financial crisis has triggered a huge interest in the use of network concepts and network tools to better understand how instabilities can propagate through the financial system. The literature is today quite vast, covering both theoretical and empirical aspects. This review concentrates on empirical work, and associated methodologies, concerned with the evaluation of the fragility and resilience of financial and credit markets. The first part of the review examines the literature on systemic risk that arise from banks mutual exposures. These exposures stem primarily from interbank lending and derivative positions, but also, indirectly, from common holdings of other asset classes, that can lead to common shocks in instances of fire sales, and from widespread non-performing loans to the real sector during period of economic downturns. We survey (a) studies that characterize the structure of national interbank networks, in some cases using a multiplex representations, (b) studies that introduce novel methods to quantify systemic risk and identify systemically important institutions, such as via stress test scenarios, (c) studies that assess which regulatory measures can help mitigate the propagation of contagion and distress in the financial system, and (d) studies that explore which location advantages may arise from holding privileged positions in the interbank network, such as via preferential lending relationships, or because of occupying a more central node, and if such advantages can provide an early indication of the build up of systemic risk. The second part of the review is dedicated to the analysis of indirect networks, specifically (e) proximity based network, i.e. networks obtained starting from a proximity measure sometime filtered with a network filtering methodology, (f) association network, i.e. networks where a link between two financial actors is set if a statistical test again a null hypothesis is rejected, and (g) statistically validated networks, i.e. event or relationship networks where a subset of links is selected according to a statistical validation associated with the rejection of a random null hypothesis. The need for a joint consideration of direct and indirect channels of contagion is briefly discussed.},

Additionally, we adapt our approach by examining the effective state of the system, rather than its natural state, and conclude that this transformation can reveal hidden EWS in networks where those signals are otherwise obscured by a complex topology.},

  abstract             = {Information cascades are important dynamical processes in complex networks. An information cascade can describe the spreading dynamics of rumour, disease, memes, or marketing campaigns, which initially start from a node or a set of nodes in the network. If conditions are right, information cascades rapidly encompass large parts of the network, thus leading to epidemics or epidemic spreading. Certain network topologies are particularly conducive to epidemics, while others decelerate and even prohibit rapid information spreading. Here we review models that describe information cascades in complex networks, with an emphasis on the role and consequences of node centrality. In particular, we present simulation results on sample networks that reveal just how relevant the centrality of initiator nodes is on the latter development of an information cascade, and we define the spreading influence of a node as the fraction of nodes that is activated as a result of the initial activation of that node. A systemic review of existing results shows that some centrality measures, such as the degree and betweenness, are positively correlated with the spreading influence, while other centrality measures, such as eccentricity and the information index, have negative correlation. A positive correlation implies that choosing a node with the highest centrality value will activate the largest number of nodes, while a negative correlation implies that the node with the lowest centrality value will have the same effect. We discuss possible applications of these results, and we emphasize how information cascades can help us identify nodes with the highest spreading capability in complex networks.},

To the best of our knowledge, there is no current comprehensive review of recent literature which uses a scientometric analysis using complex networks analysis covering all relevant articles from the Web of Science (WoS). Here we present a visual survey of key literature using CiteSpace. The idea is to identify emerging trends besides using network techniques to examine the evolution of the domain. Towards that end, we identify the most influential, central, as well as active nodes using scientometric analyses. We examine authors, key articles, cited references, core subject categories, key journals, institutions, as well as countries. The exploration of the scientometric literature of the domain reveals that Yong Wang is a pivot node with the highest centrality. Additionally, we have observed that Mark Newman is the most highly cited author in the network. We have also identified that the journal, "Reviews of Modern Physics" has the strongest citation burst. In terms of cited documents, an article by Andrea Lancichinetti has the highest centrality score. We have also discovered that the origin of the key publications in this domain is from the United States. Whereas Scotland has the strongest and longest citation burst. Additionally, we have found that the categories of "Computer Science" and "Engineering" lead other categories based on frequency and centrality respectively.},

The complex nature of a stock market challenges us on making a reliable prediction of its future movements. In this paper, we aim at building a new method to forecast the future movements of Standard and Poor's 500 Index (SandP 500) by constructing time-series complex networks of SandP 500 underlying companies by connecting them with links whose weights are given by the mutual information of 60-minute price movements of the pairs of the companies with the consecutive 5,340 minutes price records. We showed that the changes in the strength distributions of the networks provide an important information on the network's future movements. We built several metrics using the strength distributions and network measurements such as centrality, and we combined the best two predictors by performing a linear combination. We found that the combined predictor and the changes in SandP 500 show a quadratic relationship, and it allows us to predict the amplitude of the one step future change in SandP 500. The result showed significant fluctuations in SandP 500 Index when the combined predictor was high. In terms of making the actual index predictions, we built ARIMA models. We found that adding the network measurements into the ARIMA models improves the model accuracy. These findings are useful for financial market policy makers as an indicator based on which they can interfere with the markets before the markets make a drastic change, and for quantitative investors to improve their forecasting models.},

In this work we analyze stock markets of the USA and Sweden. We study cluster structures of a market network constructed from a correlation matrix of returns of the stocks traded in each of these markets. Such cluster structures are obtained by means of the P-Median Problem (PMP) whose objective is to maximize the total correlation between a set of stocks called medians of size pp and other stocks. Every cluster structure is an undirected disconnected weighted graph in which every connected component (cluster) is a star, or a tree with one central node (called a median) and several leaf nodes connected with the median by weighted edges. Our main observation is that in non-crisis periods of time cluster structures change more chaotically, while during crises they show more stable behavior and fewer changes. Thus an increasing stability of a market graph cluster structure obtained via the PMP could be used as an indicator of a coming crisis.},

The results are compared before and during the financial crisis of 2008. In the RMT method, the components of eigenvectors corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue form two clusters of indices in the positive and negative directions. The components of these two clusters switch in opposite directions during the crisis. The network analysis uses the Fruchterman-Reingold layout to find clusters in the network of indices at different thresholds. At a threshold of 0.6, before the crisis, financial indices corresponding to the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific form separate clusters. On the other hand, during the crisis at the same threshold, the American and European indices combine together to form a strongly linked cluster while the Asia-Pacific indices form a separate weakly linked cluster. If the value of the threshold is further increased to 0.9 then the European indices (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) are found to be the most tightly linked indices. The structure of the minimum spanning tree of financial indices is more starlike before the crisis and it changes to become more chainlike during the crisis. The average linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to find a clearer cluster structure in the network of financial indices. The cophenetic correlation coefficients are calculated and found to increase significantly, which indicates that the hierarchy increases during the financial crisis. These results show that there is substantial change in the structure of the organization of financial indices during a financial crisis.},

Prominent examples of such phenomena would include collapse on financial and economic networks. Intertwined nature of the dynamics of nodes in such network makes it difficult to disentangle the source and destination of a shock that percolates through the network, a property known as reflexivity. In this article, a novel methodology is proposed which combines vector autoregression model with an unique identification restrictions obtained from the topological structure of the network to uniquely characterize cascades. In particular, we show that planarity of the network allows us to statistically estimate a dynamical process consistent with the observed network and thereby uniquely identify a path for shock propagation from any chosen epicenter to all other nodes in the network. We analyze the distress propagation mechanism in closed loops giving rise to a detailed picture of the effect of feedback loops in transmitting shocks. We show usefulness and applications of the algorithm in two networks with dynamics at different time-scales: worldwide GDP growth network and stock network. In both cases, we observe that the model predicts the impact of the shocks emanating from the US would be concentrated within the cluster of developed countries and the developing countries show very muted response, which is consistent with empirical observations over the past decade.},

While a wide range tools and techniques for time series analysis already exist, the increasing availability of massive data structures calls for new approaches for multidimensional signal processing. We present here a non-parametric method to analyse multivariate time series, based on the mapping of a multidimensional time series into a multilayer network, which allows to extract information on a high dimensional dynamical system through the analysis of the structure of the associated multiplex network. The method is simple to implement, general, scalable, does not require ad hoc phase space partitioning, and is thus suitable for the analysis of large, heterogeneous and non-stationary time series. We show that simple structural descriptors of the associated multiplex networks allow to extract and quantify nontrivial properties of coupled chaotic maps, including the transition between different dynamical phases and the onset of various types of synchronization. As a concrete example we then study financial time series, showing that a multiplex network analysis can efficiently discriminate crises from periods of financial stability, where standard methods based on time-series symbolization often fail.},

The spreading power of all network nodes is better explained by considering, from a continuous-time epidemiological perspective, the distribution of the force of infection each node generates. The resulting metric, the expected force, accurately quantifies node spreading power under all primary epidemiological models across a wide range of archetypical human contact networks. When node power is low, influence is a function of neighbor degree. As power increases, a node's own degree becomes more important. The strength of this relationship is modulated by network structure, being more pronounced in narrow, dense networks typical of social networking and weakening in broader, looser association networks such as the Internet. The expected force can be computed independently for individual nodes, making it applicable for networks whose adjacency matrix is dynamic, not well specified, or overwhelmingly large.},

  abstract             = {The current practice of stocks network analysis is based on the assumption that the time series of closed stock price could represent the behaviour of the each stock. This assumption leads to consider minimal spanning tree (MST) and sub-dominant ultrametric (SDU) as an indispensible tool to filter the economic information contained in the network. Recently, there is an attempt where researchers represent stock not only as a univariate time series of closed price but as a bivariate time series of closed price and volume. In this case, they developed the so-called multidimensional MST to filter the important economic information. However, in this paper, we show that their approach is only applicable for that bivariate time series only. This leads us to introduce a new methodology to construct MST where each stock is represented by a multivariate time series. An example of Malaysian stock exchange will be presented and discussed to illustrate the advantages of the method},

We propose to design both undirected and directed volatility networks of global stock market based on simple pair-wise correlation and system-wide connectedness of national stock indices using a vector auto-regressive model. We examine the effect and usefulness of network indicators by applying them as inputs for determining strategies via several machine learning approaches (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest). Two strategies are constructed considering stock price indices: (1) global stock market prediction strategy and (2) regional allocation strategy for developed market/emerging market. According to the results of the performance analysis, network indicators were proven to be important supplementary indicators in predicting global stock market and regional relative directions (up/down). In particular, these indicators were more effective during market crisis periods. This study is the first attempt to construct strategies for global portfolio management using financial network indicators and to suggest how network indicators can be used in practical fields.},

We analyzed the dynamics of the Korean stock market network and evaluated the changing of the correlation between shares consisting of the time series data of 137 companies belong to KOSPI200. Our analysis shows that the stock prices tend to plummet when the correlation between stocks is very high. We propose a method for recommending the stock portfolio based on the analysis of the stock market network. To show the effectiveness of the recommended portfolio, we conducted the simulated stock investment and compared the recommended portfolio with the efficient portfolio proposed Markowitz. According to the experiment results, the rate of return of the portfolio is about 10.6\% which is about 3.7\% and 5.6\% higher than the average rate of return of the efficient portfolio and KOSPI200 respectively.},

  abstract       = {Firms and individuals have always searched for investment strategies that perform well and are robust to market variations. Over the years, many strategies have claimed to be effective but few resist the effect of time, that is, most of them become outdated. It turns out that markets have a -correcting ability; the secretive/novel nature of strategies firms employ cannot win forever; other firms eventually implement competing strategies causing the market to adjust. Nowadays, most investment firms to their clients two approaches: high reward and low reward. Unfortunately the possibility of high reward is generally coupled with low robustness (volatility) and if one wants high robustness the yields are low (low reward). In this paper, we use an approach based on network characteristics extracted from historical market data. Network Science has argued that all complex systems have an underlying network structure that explains the behavior of the system. With this in mind, we propose a long-term investment strategy that builds a network from historical investment data, and considers the current state of this network to decide how to create portfolios. We argue that our approach performs better than standard long-term approaches.},

Through preprocessing the data sets, we used R Studio get the mean correlation coefficient matrix, which is the foundation of the financial network. The results confirm the utility of the correlation coefficient analysis as a stability indicator for SSE stock market, since it proves that the correlation of stocks is different according to the crisis and prosperous of stock market in times. Its development is opposite to the market index, the interaction between the stocks attenuates when the complex index rises and enhances when the index falls. We also used K-means clustering algorithm to classify these nodes into different communities and found that the structures of networks vary widely according to their correlations. The method of this paper and the model it proposed is not only for the selection of our data sets, but also can be generalized to other fields of research.},

For example, in adolescent health studies of risk-taking behaviors, information on the subjects' social network is often available and plays an important role through network cohesion, the empirically observed phenomenon of friends behaving similarly. Taking cohesion into account in prediction models should allow us to improve their performance. Here we propose a network-based penalty on individual node effects to encourage similarity between predictions for linked nodes, and show that incorporating it into prediction leads to improvement over traditional models both theoretically and empirically when network cohesion is present. The penalty can be used with many loss-based prediction methods, such as regression, generalized linear models, and Cox's proportional hazard model. Applications to predicting levels of recreational activity and marijuana usage among teenagers from the AddHealth study based on both demographic covariates and friendship networks are discussed in detail and show that our approach to taking friendships into account can significantly improve predictions of behavior while providing interpretable estimates of covariate effects.},

Cross-validation is a useful general tool for model selection and parameter tuning, but is not directly applicable to networks since splitting network nodes into groups requires deleting edges and destroys some of the network structure. Here we propose a new network resampling strategy based on splitting edges rather than nodes, applicable to both cross-validation and bootstrap for a wide range of network model selection tasks. We provide a theoretical justification for our method in a general setting and examples of how our method can be used in specific network model selection and parameter tuning tasks. Numerical results on simulated networks and on a citation network of statisticians show that this cross-validation approach works well for model selection.},

  abstract             = {Many real-world networks are complex dynamical systems, where both local (e.g., changing node attributes) and global (e.g., changing network topology) processes unfold over time. Local dynamics may provoke global changes in the network, and the ability to detect such effects could have profound implications for a number of real-world problems. Most existing techniques focus individually on either local or global aspects of the problem or treat the two in isolation from each other. In this paper we propose a novel network model that simultaneously accounts for both local and global dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at modeling and detecting local and global change points on dynamic networks via a unified generative framework. Our model is built upon the popular mixed membership stochastic blockmodels (MMSB) with sparse co-evolving patterns. We derive an efficient stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) sampler for our proposed model, which allows it to scale to potentially very large networks. Finally, we validate our model on both synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate its superiority over several baselines.},

Dynamic structural features of the core and periphery nodes are investigated, and it is demonstrated that the peripherality in a network can be used as an indicator for identifying the optimal assets. With the network filtering approach and peripherality measure, portfolios with different performances are constructed. Compared to the full cross-correlation matrix, the global-motion one shows significant advantages in the portfolio optimization, and the underlying mechanism is carefully analyzed. These methods are also with potential significance to the understanding of other social, biological and transport systems.},

  abstract       = {In a financial system, the interconnectedness among entities from investing in common assets (portfolio overlaps) is considered an important channel for the propagation of systemic risk because this interconnectedness can facilitate the contagion of fire sales and lead to widespread sales as well as spiral devaluation of assets. This mechanism also applies to the stock market. Particularly, it is responsible for the presence of fragility, which is defined as the potential global instability of stock prices when confronted by a local negative shock. Thus, we propose to quantitatively explore the temporal pattern of the topological features of the portfolio overlaps network (PON) to identify fragility, with the aim of either capturing a precursor for imminent market crashes or confirming further downward falls during market turmoil. Here, PON is the projected monopartite network used to characterise the mutual overlaps between funds pairs, which is induced from the bipartite network of stocks-funds ownerships. Further, we adopt a solid statistical procedure to construct the validated PON by filtering out mildly risky connections that are not statistically robust. Based on an empirical investigation of the Chinese stock market from 2005--2018 that witnessed collective unquenchable price slumps, we found that the topology of the validated PON can indeed provide some sensible indicators for identifying market fragility. The results suggest that (i) the average closeness centrality and the critical value of effective infection rate could serve as leading indicators of impending market turmoil, and (ii) the simple degree-based measure for nodes and relative frequency measures for links are actual synchronous indicators that could also explain the source of fragility.},

Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

A rather compact and well-organized sector correlation network is indicative of a healthy market, whereas a widely spread sector correlation network characterizes a more fragile market environment. Intuitively, some characteristics of the correlation network can serve as natural measures of systemic risk. Pursuing an equity market timing strategy we document the predictive content of these measures to translate into a meaningful portfolio utility. Moreover, this result continues to hold when controlling for common predictors of the equity risk premium. Not only can correlation networks be useful as an aggregate market timing signal but also in navigating the cross-section of equity sectors. We especially document a significant outperformance of peripheral versus central equity sectors that cannot be explained by momentum or low volatility effects. Finally, we implement a parametric portfolio policy that comprises the complete information content of the sector network topology conditional on a given level of risk aversion.},

  abstract             = {The authors introduce a new approach to identifying and monitoring systemic risk that combines network analysis and tail risk contribution (TRC). Network analysis provides great flexibility in representing and exploring linkages between institutions, but it can be overly general in describing the risk exposures of one entity to another. TRC provides a more focused view of key systemic risks and richer financial intuition, but it may miss important linkages between financial institutions. Integrating these two methods can provide information on key relationships between institutions that may become relevant during periods of systemic stress. The authors demonstrate this approach using the exposures of money market funds to major financial institutions during July 2011. The results for their example suggest that TRC networks can highlight both institutions and funds that may become distressed during a financial crisis.},

The vital nodes identification attracts increasing attentions from both computer science and physical societies, with algorithms ranging from simply counting the immediate neighbors to complicated machine learning and message passing approaches. In this review, we clarify the concepts and metrics, classify the problems and methods, as well as review the important progresses and describe the state of the art. Furthermore, we provide extensive empirical analyses to compare well-known methods on disparate real networks, and highlight the future directions. In spite of the emphasis on physics-rooted approaches, the unification of the language and comparison with cross-domain methods would trigger interdisciplinary solutions in the near future.},

The underlying idea of TMFG consists in building a triangulation that maximizes a score function associated with the amount of information retained by the network. TMFG uses as weights any arbitrary similarity measure to arrange data into a meaningful network structure that can be used for clustering, community detection and modelling. The method is fast, adaptable and scalable to very large datasets; it allows online updating and learning as new data can be inserted and deleted with combinations of local and non-local moves. Further, TMFG permits readjustments of the network in consequence of changes in the strength of the similarity measure. The method is based on local topological moves and can therefore take advantage of parallel and GPUs computing. We discuss how this network-filtering method can be used intuitively and efficiently for big data studies and its significance from an information-theoretic perspective.},

  abstract       = {Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the use of machine learning to help aid in the accurate predictions of financial markets. Despite the exciting advances in this cross-section of finance and AI, many of the current approaches are limited to using technical analysis to capture historical trends of each stock price and thus limited to certain experimental setups to obtain good prediction results. On the other hand, professional investors additionally use their rich knowledge of inter-market and inter-company relations to map the connectivity of companies and events, and use this map to make better market predictions. For instance, they would predict the movement of a certain company's stock price based not only on its former stock price trends but also on the performance of its suppliers or customers, the overall industry, macroeconomic factors and trade policies. This paper investigates the effectiveness of work at the intersection of market predictions and graph neural networks, which hold the potential to mimic the ways in which investors make decisions by incorporating company knowledge graphs directly into the predictive model. The main goal of this work is to test the validity of this approach across different markets and longer time horizons for backtesting using rolling window analysis. In this work, we concentrate on the prediction of individual stock prices in the Japanese Nikkei 225 market over a period of roughly 20 years. For the knowledge graph, we use the Nikkei Value Search data, which is a rich dataset showing mainly supplier relations among Japanese and foreign companies. Our preliminary results show a 29.5\% increase and a 2.2-fold increase in the return ratio and Sharpe ratio, respectively, when compared to the market benchmark, as well as a 6.32\% increase and 1.3-fold increase, respectively, compared to the baseline LSTM model.},

We build dynamically Planar Maximally Filtered Graphs from the correlation structure over a rolling window and we study the persistence of the associated Directed Bubble Hierarchical Tree (DBHT) clustering structure. We observe that the DBHT clustering structure is quite stable during the early 2000' becoming gradually less persistent before the unfolding of the 2007-2008 crisis. The correlation structure eventually recovers persistence in the aftermath of the crisis settling up a new phase, distinct from the pre-cysts structure, where the market structure is less related to industrial sector activity. Notably, we observe that - presently - the correlation structure is loosing again persistence indicating the building-up of another, different, phase. Such dynamical changes in persistence and their occurrence at the unfolding of financial crises rises concerns about the effectiveness of correlation-based portfolio management tools for risk diversification.},

In particular, we introduce a new measure, the "correlation structure persistence", that quantifies the rate of change of the market dependence structure. This measure shows a deep interplay with changes in volatility and we demonstrate it can anticipate market risk variations. Notably, our method overcomes the curse of dimensionality that limits the applicability of traditional econometric tools to portfolios made of a large number of assets. We report on forecasting performances and statistical significance of this tool for two different equity datasets. We also identify an optimal region of parameters in terms of True Positive and False Positive trade-off, through a ROC curve analysis. We find that our forecasting method is robust and it outperforms predictors based on past volatility only. Moreover the temporal analysis indicates that our method is able to adapt to abrupt changes in the market, such as financial crises, more rapidly than methods based on past volatility.},

We show that this technique has an important effect on correlation coefficient distribution by applying it for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). To study the topological structure of a network we apply the removing market mode technique and the threshold method to Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) as an example. We show that this network follows a power-law model in certain interval. We also show the behavior of clustering coefficients and component numbers of this network for different thresholds.

We find that the degree is related to the average correlation coefficient, and furthermore, it also has a relationship between the components of the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue. We apply existing research to confirm that the community structure of the kNN network can be used to cluster financial time series. Finally, empirical studies based on financial markets in three countries show that there is a high correlation between the community structure and dimensions. Therefore, this study shows that the structure of the financial kNN network is related to the properties of the correlation matrix, and it extracts a meaningful correlation structure.},

The Jaccard similarities identified the change in the market state due to a crisis in both markets. The dynamic change of the Jaccard index can be used as an indicator of systemic risk or precursors of the crisis.},

Both measures aim to specify the direction of the interrelationships among the international stock indexes and portray the links of the resulting networks, by the presence of direct couplings between variables exploiting all available information. However, their differences are assessed due to the presence of nonlinearity. The weighted networks formed with respect to the causality measures are transformed to binary ones using a significance test. The financial networks are formed on sliding windows in order to examine the network characteristics and trace changes in the connectivity structure. Subsequently, two statistical network quantities are calculated; the average degree and the average shortest path length. The empirical findings reveal interesting time-varying properties of the constructed network, which are clearly dependent on the nature of the financial cycle.},

In this study, a financial market is conceived as a network where the securities are nodes and the links account for returns' correlations. We theoretically prove the negative relationship between the centrality of assets in this financial market network and their optimal weights under the Markowitz framework. Therefore, optimal portfolios overweight low-central securities to avoid the large variances that result when highly influential stocks are included in the investor's opportunity set. Next, we empirically investigate the major financial and market determinants of stock's centralities. The evidence indicates that highly central nodes tend to coincide with older, larger-cap, cheaper and financially riskier securities. Finally, we explore by means of in-sample and out-of-sample analysis the extent to which the structure of the stock market network can be employed to improve the portfolio selection process. We propose a network-based investment strategy that outperforms well-known benchmarks while presenting positive and significant Carhart alphas. The major contribution of the paper is to employ the financial market network as a useful device to improve the portfolio selection process by targeting a group of assets according to their centrality.},

The weight of the link (i, j), which quantifies the similarity between the two corresponding time series, is defined according to a metric based on symbolic time series analysis, which has recently proved effective in the context of financial time series. Then, searching for network communities allows one to identify groups of nodes (and then time series) with strong similarity. A quantitative assessment of the significance of the obtained partition is also provided. The method is applied to two distinct case-studies concerning the US and Italy Stock Exchange, respectively. In the US case, the stability of the partitions over time is also thoroughly investigated. The results favorably compare with those obtained with the standard tools typically used for clustering financial time series, such as the minimal spanning tree and the hierarchical tree.},

Layers represent direct financial exposures of various types, including interbank liabilities, derivative- or foreign exchange exposures. Another network layer of systemic risk emerges through common asset holdings of financial institutions. Strongly overlapping portfolios lead to similar exposures that are caused by price movements of the underlying financial assets. Based on the knowledge of portfolio holdings of financial agents we quantify systemic risk of overlapping portfolios. We present an optimization procedure, where we minimize the systemic risk in a given financial market by optimally rearranging overlapping portfolio networks, under the constraints that the expected returns and risks of the individual portfolios are unchanged. We explicitly demonstrate the power of the method on the overlapping portfolio network of sovereign exposure between major European banks by using data from the European Banking Authority stress test of 2016. We show that systemic-risk-efficient allocations are accessible by the optimization. In the case of sovereign exposure, systemic risk can be reduced by more than a factor of two, with- out any detrimental effects for the individual banks. These results are confirmed by a simple simulation of fire sales in the government bond market. In particular we show that the contagion probability is reduced dramatically in the optimized network.},

We observed that that obvious linkage effects existed among stock networks. CII and CCE, CAG and ITH as well as COU, CHA and REI were confirmed as the core nodes in the three different networks respectively. We also investigated the stability of linkage effects by estimating the mean correlations and mean distances, as well as the normalized tree length of these indices. In addition, using the GMM model approach, we found inter-node influence within the stock network had a pronounced effect on stock returns. Our results generally suggested that there appeared to be greater clustering effect among the indexes belonging to related industrial sectors than those of diverse sectors, and network comovement was significantly affected by impactive financial events in the reality. Besides, stocks that were more central within the network of stock market usually had higher returns for compensation because they endured greater exposure to correlation risk.},

Specifically, communities are groups of nodes that are densely connected among each other but connect sparsely with others. However, detecting communities in networks is so far a major challenge, in particular, when networks evolve in time. Here, we propose a change in the community detection approach. It underlies in defining an intrinsic dynamic for the nodes of the network as interacting particles (based on diffusive equations of motion and on the topological properties of the network) that results in a fast convergence of the particle system into clustered patterns. The resulting patterns correspond to the communities of the network. Since our detection of communities is constructed from a dynamical process, it is able to analyse time-varying networks straightforwardly. Moreover, for static networks, our numerical experiments show that our approach achieves similar results as the methodologies currently recognized as the most efficient ones. Also, since our approach defines an N-body problem, it allows for efficient numerical implementations using parallel computations that increase its speed performance.},

The proposed centrality of the layers (influences) and the centrality of the nodes are determined by a coupled set of equations. The basic idea consists in assigning more centrality to nodes that receive links from highly influential layers and from already central nodes. The layers are more influential if highly central nodes are active in them. The algorithm applies to directed/undirected as well as to weighted/unweighted multiplex networks.

Many researchers have worked on methods that can efficiently unveil substructures in complex networks, giving birth to the field of community discovery. A novel and challenging problem started capturing researcher interest recently: the identification of evolving communities. To model the evolution of a system, dynamic networks can be used: nodes and edges are mutable and their presence, or absence, deeply impacts the community structure that composes them. The aim of this survey is to present the distinctive features and challenges of dynamic community discovery, and propose a classification of published approaches. As a "user manual", this work organizes state of art methodologies into a taxonomy, based on their rationale, and their specific instanciation. Given a desired definition of network dynamics, community characteristics and analytical needs, this survey will support researchers to identify the set of approaches that best fit their needs. The proposed classification could also help researchers to choose in which direction should future research be oriented.},

Complex networks describe a widespread variety of systems in nature and society especially systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical entities. Complex networks like real networks can also have community structure. There are several types of methods and algorithms for detection and identification of communities in complex networks. Several complex networks have the property of clustering or network transitivity. Some of the important concepts in the field of complex networks are small-world and scale-robustness, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth, dynamical processes on networks, etc. Some current areas of research on complex network communities are those on community evolution, overlapping communities, communities in directed networks, community characterization and interpretation, etc. Many of the algorithms or methods proposed for network community detection through clustering are modified versions of or inspired from the concepts of minimum-cut based algorithms, hierarchical connectivity based algorithms, the original GirvanNewman algorithm, concepts of modularity maximization, algorithms utilizing metrics from information and coding theory, and clique based algorithms.},

The topologies of these networks are analyzed using node strength for networks based on correlation, and in and out node strengths for networks based on TE. Our results indicate that node strengths peak in times of crisis, such as the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European sovereign debt crisis, as well as in the years after 2010.

In the presence of q communities, the number of eigenvectors corresponding to the q largest eigenvalues form a "community" eigenspace and rotate together, but separately from that of the "bulk" eigenspace spanned by all the other eigenvectors. Using this property, the number of modules or clusters in a network can be estimated in an algorithm-independent way. A general argument and derivation for the theoretical detectability limit for sparse modular networks with q communities is presented, beyond which modularity persists in the system but cannot be detected. It is shown that for detecting the clusters or modules using the adjacency matrix, there is a "band" in which it is hard to detect the clusters even before the theoretical detectability limit is reached, and for which the theoretically predicted detectability limit forms the sufficient upper bound. Analytic estimations of these bounds are presented and empirically demonstrated.},

AMEs use attentive gating networks trained with a Granger-causal objective to learn to jointly produce accurate predictions as well as estimates of feature importance in a single model. Our experiments show (i) that the feature importance estimates provided by AMEs compare favourably to those provided by state-of-theart methods, (ii) that AMEs are significantly faster at estimating feature importance than existing methods, and (iii) that the associations discovered by AMEs are consistent with those reported by domain experts.},

We propose an inferential tool based on egonets to answer this question. The proposed method is computationally efficient and naturally amenable to parallel computing, and easily extends to a wide variety of network models. We demonstrate through simulation studies that the egonet method works well under a wide variety of network models. We obtain some fascinating empirical results by applying the egonet method on several well-studied benchmark datasets.},

Increase is caused by clusters of countries having high within-cluster correlation. Geographic proximity plays important role in high within-cluster co-movement. Budget balance to GDP ratio plays an important role in post-crisis segmentation. Using dynamic conditional correlations and network theory, this study brings a novel interdisciplinary framework to define the integration and segmentation of emerging countries. The individual EMBI+ spreads of 13 emerging countries from January 2003 to December 2013 are used to compare their interaction structure before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) the global financial crisis. Accordingly, the unweighted average of dynamic conditional correlations between cross country bond returns significantly increases in phase 2. At first glance, the increased co-movement degree suggests an integration of the sample countries after the crisis. However, using correlation based stable networks, we show that this is not enough to make such a strong conclusion. In particular, we reveal that the increased average correlation is more likely to be caused by clusters of countries that exhibit high within-cluster co-movement but not between-cluster co-movement. Potential reasons for the post-crisis segmentation and important implications for international investors and policymakers are discussed.},

At the heart of the system lies the stock exchange mechanism, which establishes a time-evolving network of trades among companies and individuals. Such network can be inferred through correlations between time series of companies stock prices, allowing the overall system to be characterized by techniques borrowed from network science. Here we study the presence of communities in the inferred stock market network, and show that the knowledge about the communities alone can provide a nearly complete representation of the system topology. This is done by defining a simple null model, a randomized version of the studied network sharing only the sizes and interconnectivity between communities observed. We show that many topological characteristics of the inferred networks are carried over the networks generated by the null model. In particular, we find that in periods of instability, such as during a financial crisis, the network strays away from a state of well-defined community structure to a much more uniform topological organization. We show that the framework presented here provides a good null model representation of topological variations taking place in the market during crises. Also, the general approach used in this work can be extended to other systems.},

The methodology involves identifying important correlations between the time series as well as monitoring individual series to determine which ones have extreme return values compared with their past performance. Analysis is presented visually to give quick insight into a complex system moving in time; for example, systemically important assets are easily recognizable as those that are central in the minimum spanning tree structure of the correlation matrix, and systemic events are visible as large numbers of assets having extreme values.

Furthermore, we test the similarity percentage of the eight causality methods and we find that the most similar pair of causality-induced networks is on average less than 50\% similar throughout the time period examined, thus rendering the comparability and substitutability of these causality methods rather dubious. We also rank the assets in terms of overall out-strength centrality and we find that there is an underlying bonds regime almost monopolizing (in some cases) the causality methods. Finally, using network visualization, we observe an established pattern (ie, across all causalities) of oil's increasing role as the financial network faced the Chinese stock market crash.},

  abstract             = {Financial networks could become fragile during periods of economic and financial distress, since interconnectedness among participating firms could transmit and amplify adverse shocks. Relying on balance sheet data, complemented with information on interbank exposures, this paper analyses interconnectedness in an advanced emerging market economy, using two complementary approaches. The first approach focuses on the financial network topology, and finds that the financial system resembles a highly clustered small world network, with in and out-degrees, connectivity and exposures exhibiting a (double) heavy tail behaviour, which favours the formation of strong community structure and preferential attachment in the network. Bank size is Pareto distributed, and highly correlated with centrality. The second approach focuses on how the network topology contributes to the transmission of shocks by modelling default contagion, using balance sheet network analysis. It finds that direct counterparty credit exposure poses less risk to the banking system than fire sale losses triggered by liquidity shocks. Both approaches, either using a topological or induced system losses perspective, identify systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) consistently by accounting for both macro and microprudential risk dimensions.},

This paper proposes a new way to analyze the formation reasons of community structure and important nodes of the stock market, which integrates complex networks and financial econometric methods. This paper conducts empirical study for Chinese stock market to illustrate the usefulness and advantage of our new methods. The empirical results show that it is the pricing factors such as yearly abnormal returns, price volatility, price level and leverage that drives the stocks rather than industry sector. Our study provides new evidence to help us understand the stock market and stock pricing. Particularly, the results of this paper can help understand the sector rotation effect in the stock market.},

  abstract             = {Numerous centrality measures have been developed to quantify the importances of nodes in time-independent networks, and many of them can be expressed as the leading eigenvector of some matrix. With the increasing availability of network data that changes in time, it is important to extend such eigenvector-based centrality measures to time-dependent networks. In this paper, we introduce a principled generalization of network centrality measures that is valid for any eigenvector-based centrality. We consider a temporal network with N nodes as a sequence of T layers that describe the network during different time windows, and we couple centrality matrices for the layers into a supracentrality matrix of size NT x NT whose dominant eigenvector gives the centrality of each node i at each time t. We refer to this eigenvector and its components as a joint centrality, as it reflects the importances of both the node i and the time layer t. We also introduce the concepts of marginal and conditional centralities, which facilitate the study of centrality trajectories over time. We find that the strength of coupling between layers is important for determining multiscale properties of centrality, such as localization phenomena and the time scale of centrality changes. In the strong-coupling regime, we derive expressions for time-averaged centralities, which are given by the zeroth-order terms of a singular perturbation expansion. We also study first-order terms to obtain first-order-mover scores, which concisely describe the magnitude of the nodes' centrality changes over time. As examples, we apply our method to three empirical temporal networks: the United States Ph.D. exchange in mathematics, costarring relationships among top-billed actors during the Golden Age of Hollywood, and citations of decisions from the United States Supreme Court.},

The nodes are the stocks, and the connections are determined by cross correlations of the variations of the stock prices, price returns and trading volumes within a chosen period of time. Specifically, a winner-take-all approach is used to determine if two nodes are connected by an edge. So far, no previous work has attempted to construct a full network of US stock prices that gives full information about their interdependence. We report that all networks based on connecting stocks of highly correlated stock prices, price returns and trading volumes, display a scalefree degree distribution. The results from this work clearly suggest that the variation of stock prices are strongly influenced by a relatively small number of stocks. We propose a new approach for selecting stocks for inclusion in a stock index and compare it with existing indexes. From the composition of the highly connected stocks, it can be concluded that the market is heavily dominated by stocks in the financial sector.},

With the aim to improve risk-return characteristics of well-known return maximization and risk minimization benchmark portfolios, we propose simple adjustments to portfolio selection strategy, which utilizes centralization measures from financial networks. On a sample of 45 assets (stock market indices, bond and money market instruments, commodities, and foreign exchange rates) and data from 1999 until 2015, we show that irrespective of the network and centrality employed, proposed network-based asset allocation strategies improve key portfolio return characteristics in an out-of-sample framework, most notably risk and left-tail risk adjusted returns. Resolving the portfolio model selection uncertainty further improves risk-return characteristics. Improvements for portfolio strategies based on risk minimization are also robust to transaction costs.},

We propose a new method for constructing the MST-Partial. We use daily price indices of 57 stock markets from 2005 to 2014 and find (i) that the distributions of the Pearson correlation coefficient and the partial correlation coefficient differ completely, which implies that the correlation between pairs of stock markets is greatly affected by other markets, and (ii) that both MSTs are scale-free networks and that the MST-Pearson network is more compact than the MST-Partial. Depending on the geographical locations of the stock markets, two large clusters (i.e., European and Asia-Pacific) are formed in the MST-Pearson, but in the MST-Partial the European cluster splits into two subgroups bridged by the American cluster with the USA at its center. We also find (iii) that the centrality structure indicates that outcomes obtained from the MST-Partial are more reasonable and useful than those from the MST-Pearson, e.g., in the MST-Partial, markets of the USA, Germany, and Japan clearly serve as hubs or connectors in world stock markets, (iv) that during the 2008 financial crisis the time-varying topological measures of the two MSTs formed a valley, implying that during a crisis stock markets are tightly correlated and information (e.g., about price fluctuations) is transmitted quickly, and (v) that the presence of multi-step survival ratios indicates that network stability decreases as step length increases. From these findings we conclude that the MST-Partial is an effective new tool for use by international investors and hedge-fund operators.},

The residual switching network architecture combines two separate residual networks (ResNets), namely a switching module that learns stock market conditions, and the main module that learns momentum and reversal predictors. We demonstrate that over-fitting noisy financial data can be controlled with stacked residual blocks and further incorporating the attention mechanism can enhance powerful predictive properties. Over the period 2008 to H12017, the residual switching network (Switching-ResNet) strategy verified superior out-of-sample performance with an average annual Sharpe ratio of 2.22, compared with an average annual Sharpe ratio of 0.81 for the ANN-based strategy and 0.69 for the linear model.},

  abstract             = {Tail dependence structure of the FX market is studied from a perspective of network. A concept of lower- and upper-tail dependence networks is proposed. The networks are built by combining the SJC copula with the MST and PMFG. Some notable differences between the two tail dependence networks are found. 3-cliques, 4-cliques and communities are detected in the two tail dependence PMFGs. Tail dependence of financial entities describes when the price of one financial asset has an extreme fluctuation (e.g., price sharply rises or falls), the degree of its effect on the price fluctuation of another asset. Under the background of the global financial crisis, tail dependence structure of financial entities plays an important role in financial risk management, portfolio selection, and asset pricing. In this paper, we propose a concept of tail dependence networks to investigate the tail dependence structure of the foreign exchange (FX) market. Lower- and upper-tail dependence networks for 42 major currencies in the FX market from 2005 to 2012 are constructed by combing the symmetrized Joe-Clayton copula model and two filtered graph algorithms, i.e., the minimum spanning tree (MST) and the planar maximally filtered graph (PMFG). We also construct the tail dependence hierarchical trees (HTs) associated with the MSTs to analyze the currency clusters. We find that (1) the two series of lower- and upper-tail dependence coefficients present different statistical properties; (2) the upper-tail dependence networks are tighter than the lower-tail dependence networks; and (3) different currency clusters, cliques and communities are respectively found in the two tail dependence networks. The key empirical results indicate that market participants should consider the different topological features at different market situations (e.g., a booming market or a recession market) to make decisions on the investing or hedging strategies. Overall, our obtained results based on the tail dependence networks are new insights in financial management and supply a novel analytical tool for market participants.},

The closing prices of 710 stocks in the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) from 2005 to 2011 are chosen as the empirical data. We divide the period into three sub-periods: before, during, and after the US sub-prime crisis. By monitoring the size of the clusters which fall apart from the network after removing the nodes (i.e., the listed companies in the SSE), we find that: (i) the SSE network is sensitive to the nodes' failure, which implies that the network is unstable. (ii) the SSE network before the financial crisis has the strongest robustness against the intentional topological damage; (iii) the hubs (i.e., highly connected nodes) connect with each other directly and play a vital important role in maintaining SSE network's stability.},

  abstract     = {Investors in stock market are usually greedy during bull markets and scared during bear markets. The greed or fear spreads across investors quickly. This is known as the herding effect, and often leads to a fast movement of stock prices. During such market regimes, stock prices change at a super-exponential rate and are normally followed by a trend reversal that corrects the previous overreaction.

In this paper, we construct an indicator to measure the magnitude of the super-exponential growth of stock prices, by measuring the degree of the price network, generated from the price time series.

Twelve major international stock indices have been investigated. Error diagram tests show that this new indicator has strong predictive power for financial extremes, both peaks and troughs. By varying the parameters used to construct the error diagram, we show the predictive power is very robust. The new indicator has a better performance than the LPPL pattern recognition indicator.},

A similar trend is currently appearing within the econometrics and finance communities, as well. In this study, we present a state-of-the-artmethod for analyzing the structure and risk within stockmarkets, treating them as complex networks using model-free, nonlinear dependency measures based on information theory. This study is the first network analysis of the stockmarket in Shanghai using a nonlinear network methodology. Further, it is often assumed that markets outside the United States and Western Europe are inherently riskier. We find that the Chinese stock market is not structurally risky, contradicting this popular opinion. We use partial mutual information to create filtered networks representing the Shanghai stock exchange, comparing them to networks based on Pearson's correlation. Consequently, we discuss the structure and characteristics of both the presented methods and the Shanghai stock exchange. This paper provides an insight into the cutting edge methodology designed for analyzing complex financial networks, as well as analyzing the structure of the market in Shanghai and, as such, is of interest to both researchers and financial analysts.},

To tackle this general problem, two methods have emerged, at chronologically different times, that are now commonly used in the scientific community: data mining and complex network theory. Not only do complex network analysis and data mining share the same general goal, that of extracting information from complex systems to ultimately create a new compact quantifiable representation, but they also often address similar problems too. In the face of that, a surprisingly low number of researchers turn out to resort to both methodologies. One may then be tempted to conclude that these two fields are either largely redundant or totally antithetic. The starting point of this review is that this state of affairs should be put down to contingent rather than conceptual differences, and that these two fields can in fact advantageously be used in a synergistic manner. An overview of both fields is first provided, some fundamental concepts of which are illustrated. A variety of contexts in which complex network theory and data mining have been used in a synergistic manner are then presented. Contexts in which the appropriate integration of complex network metrics can lead to improved classification rates with respect to classical data mining algorithms and, conversely, contexts in which data mining can be used to tackle important issues in complex network theory applications are illustrated. Finally, ways to achieve a tighter integration between complex networks and data mining, and open lines of research are discussed.},

The centrality measure in the financial network structure captures firms' embeddedness and connectivity in the capital market structure. This paper investigates firms' centrality in the financial network as an explanatory variable in corporate-failure prediction as well as a measure of firms' systemic importance. First, when analyzing credit default swap (CDS) spreads, we find that peripheral firms in the network have higher average CDS spreads and a higher propensity for CDS jump events. Second, centrality is found to increase the explanatory power of default prediction models, and, moreover, it is negatively related to failure and bankruptcy probability. This implies that peripheral firms in the network are more likely to fail. Finally, by examining the out-of-sample performance of centrality as a measure of systemic importance, we find that centrality correctly distinguishes the firms that suffered higher losses during the 2007-8 crisis period.},

In this regard, as retail investors are prone to be influenced by news or other social media, psychological and behavioral features extracted from social media platforms are thought to well predict stock price movements in the China's market. Recent advances in the investor social network in China enables the extraction of such features from web-scale data. In this paper, on the basis of tweets from Xueqiu, a popular Chinese Twitter-like social platform specialized for investors, we analyze features with regard to collective sentiment and perception on stock relatedness and predict stock price movements by employing nonlinear models. The features of interest prove to be effective in our experiments.},

The most commonly employed approaches for network adaptation are fine-tuning and using the pre-trained network as a fixed feature extractor, among others. In this paper, we propose a straightforward alternative: Side-Tuning. Side-tuning adapts a pre-trained network by training a lightweight "side" network that is fused with the (unchanged) pre-trained network using summation. This simple method works as well as or better than existing solutions while it resolves some of the basic issues with fine-tuning, fixed features, and several other common baselines. In particular, side-tuning is less prone to overfitting when little training data is available, yields better results than using a fixed feature extractor, and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning. We demonstrate the performance of side-tuning under a diverse set of scenarios, including lifelong learning (iCIFAR, Taskonomy), reinforcement learning, imitation learning (visual navigation in Habitat), NLP question-answering (SQuAD v2), and single-task transfer learning (Taskonomy), with consistently promising results.},

Novel state-space models characterizing sparse patterns of dependence among multiple time series extend existing multivariate volatility models to enable scaling to higher numbers of individual time series. The theory of these "dynamic dependence network" models shows how the individual series can be "decoupled" for sequential analysis, and then "recoupled" for applied forecasting and decision analysis. Decoupling allows fast, efficient analysis of each of the series in individual univariate models that are linked-- for later recoupling-- through a theoretical multivariate volatility structure defined by a sparse underlying graphical model. Computational advances are especially significant in connection with model uncertainty about the sparsity patterns among series that define this graphical model; Bayesian model averaging using discounting of historical information builds substantially on this computational advance. An extensive, detailed case study showcases the use of these models, and the improvements in forecasting and financial portfolio investment decisions that are achievable. Using a long series of daily international currency, stock indices and commodity prices, the case study includes evaluations of multi-day forecasts and Bayesian portfolio analysis with a variety of practical utility functions, as well as comparisons against commodity trading advisor benchmarks.},

Those portfolios, which are composed of peripheral stocks with low temporal centrality scores, have consistently better performance under different portfolio optimization schemes, suggesting that the temporal centrality measure can be used as new portfolio optimization and risk management tools. Our results reveal the importance of the temporal attributes of the stock markets, which should be taken serious consideration in real life applications.},

The network dissection is further applied to analyze how the units acting as semantic detectors grow and evolve over the training iterations both in the scenario of the train-from-scratch and in the stage of the fine-tuning between data sources.

A long-short strategy using the indirect links yields a risk-adjusted monthly alpha of 198 (164) basis points with equal (value) weights. We further find that (i) the indirect citation links are much more complex than direct ones, (ii) the magnitude of cross predictability increases with the degree of link complexity, (iii) institutional investors don't adjust their positions in a stock with complex links, but in one with simple links immediately, (iv) firms with more complex links receive more public attention, are much larger in size, and exhibit less idiosyncratic volatility than those with simple links, (v) there is little role of the usual proxies for limited investor attention and arbitrage cost in explaining our anomalies, once controlling for the linking complexity, and (vi) there are no differences in expected returns of stocks with various link complexity.},

  abstract       = {In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.},

The dynamics of the shape and the descriptive statistics of these trees are analyzed in various investment domains. The method provides evidence of regime changes in dependency structures prior to market sell-offs, and as such, it is a potential candidate for monitoring systemic risk. We also provide empirical evidence that the assets that are located towards the center of the network tend to have higher returns.

Time-series clustering is no exception, with the Dynamic Time Warping distance being particularly popular in that context. This distance is computationally expensive, so many related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript, a general overview of time-series clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and other recently proposed techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package for the R statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can be used to evaluate many different time-series clustering procedures.},

In more detail, the modified Top-Down recursive division is based on the shape of dendrogram, follows an Equal Risk Contribution allocation and is extended to downside risk measures such as conditional value at risk (CVaR) and Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR). The out-of-sample performances of hierarchical clustering based portfolios are evaluated across two empirical datasets, which differ in terms of number of assets and composition of the universe (multi-assets and individual stocks). Empirical results highlight that HERC Portfolios based on downside risk measures achieve statistically better risk-adjusted performances, especially those based on the CDaR.},

Three different methods are proposed in order to extract the dependence structure between assets in a network context. Starting from this modified structure, we formulate and then we solve the asset allocation problem. We find that the portfolios obtained through a network-based approach are composed mainly of peripheral assets, which are poorly connected with the others. These portfolios, in the majority of cases, are characterized by an higher trade-off between performance and risk with respect to the traditional Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolio. Additionally, this methodology benefits of a graphical visualization of the selected portfolio directly over the graphic layout of the network, which helps in improving our understanding of the optimal strategy.},

HRP applies modern mathematics (graph theory and machine-learning techniques) to build a diversified portfolio based on the information contained in the covariance matrix. However, unlike quadratic optimizers, HRP does not require the invertibility of the covariance matrix. In fact, HRP can compute a portfolio on an ill-degenerated or even a singular covariance matrix an impossible feat for quadratic optimizers. Monte Carlo experiments show that HRP delivers lower out-ofsample variance than CLA, even though minimum variance is CLA's optimization objective. HRP also produces less risky portfolios out of sample compared to traditional risk parity methods.},

Utilizing a multi asset dataset, we measure interconnectedness risk by the embeddedness intensity, i.e. centrality, of assets in a correlation network, a concept from graph theory. Using the most common centrality measures, we first conduct empirical similarity studies analyzing how different centrality scores relate to each other and to conventional portfolio optimization inputs. Next, we outline how centrality can be incorporated in a risk-based as well as in a risk-return-based framework. Out-of-sample performance studies of centrality-optimized portfolios prove their competitiveness.},

While the Pearson correlation coefficient is a popular choice, we are especially interested in a measure based on the lower tail dependence coefficient. Such innovation is expected to achieve better tail risk management in the context of allocating to skewed style factor strategies. Indeed, the corresponding hierarchical risk parity strategies seem to have been navigating the associated downside risk better, yet come at the cost of high turnover.

This study empirically investigates the effects of common factors on the connectivity of the network among stocks and on the distribution of the investment weights for stocks. The network is defined as a stock correlation network from the minimal spanning tree (MST), and portfolio is defined as an efficient portfolio from the Markowitz mean-variance (MV) optimization function (MVOF). For these research goals, we devise a method using the comparative correlation matrix (C-CM), which does not have the property of a single common factor included in the sample correlation matrix (S-CM). The results reveal that common factors clearly affect the changes of connectivity among stocks in the networks, and that their influence is much greater on stocks with many links to other stocks in the network. Further, common factors significantly affect the determination of the investment weight's distribution for stocks from the MVOF. In particular, among the common factors, a market factor plays a dominant role in both structuring the network among stocks and in constructing the well-diversified portfolio. In addition, the devised method of the C-CM without the property of the market factor in the S-CM plays a crucial role in constructing a more diversified portfolio with better out-of-sample performance in the future period. These results are robust in both the Korean and the U.S. stocks markets.},

  abstract             = {We investigate the use of machine learning techniques into building statistically stable systematic allocation strategies. Traditionally, allocation processes usually rely on variations of Markowitz framework such as Mean Variance allocation, Maximum Diversity, Risk Parity, Conditional Value at Risk, ie convex frontier optimization. Although those methods show some efficiency to allocate assets through the convex efficient frontier, they usually rely deeply on the estimation and the usage of the covariance matrix. Being no stationary and having multiple range memory (ie FIGARCH), the statistical estimation of covariance may lead to biases and errors and in the end, bias conclusions. Very extensive literature in econo-metrics, econo-physics, quantitative allocation cover this problem in order to remedy to the statistical estimation of covariance and his bias and issues.Here, our emphasis is not a new estimator of the covariance matrix, or a variant of Risk Parity but an application of Machine Learning techniques to infer no-linear relationships and long range memory between the assets.It has the advantage to remove the linear projection of the assets onto the covariance framework and then capture no-linear relationships between at various time periods.Recent advances in Neural Network, Deep Learning and Machine Learning allows a more efficient modeling of the no-linear statistical relationships between data (ie price, dividends,....). Among them, we can mention Restricted Boltzman Machines, Variationnal Auto-encoders and variations of Recurrent Neural Network, Highway Long Short Term Memory Network as well as Factorization Machines for projection on local sub-spaces.Thus, we investigate some of the techniques to develop practical systematic allocation strategies by reducing risks and estimations biases and show the results.},

  abstract             = {In the last years, many clustering techniques dealing with time course data have been proposed due to recent interests in studying phenomena that change over time. A new clustering method suitable for time series applications has been recently proposed by exploiting the properties of the P-splines approach. This semi-parametric tool has several advantages, i.e. it facilitates the removal of noise from time series and it ensures a computational time saving. In this paper, we propose to use this clustering approach on financial data with the aim of building a financial portfolio. Our proposal works directly on time series without any pre-processing, except for the computation of the spline coefficients and, eventually, normalizing the series. We show that our strategy is useful to support the investment decisions of financial practitioners.},

  abstract       = {Systematic macro investors use of the regime-switching models that have been developed in academia over the last several decades is infrequent at best and, when used, generally tangential to their core investment process. The roots of this less-than-enthusiastic uptake can be found in two familiar sources: models that possess an overly complex formal structure and poor predictive ability. As a remedy to the current state of affairs, the authors present a new foundation for regime-based investing, one based on spectral clustering, a graph theoretic approach to classifying data. Drawing inspiration from the work of Hyman Minsky and John Geanakoplos, the authors present a macro framework that uses measures of growth, inflation, and leverage to define regimes and drive portfolio decisions. To the latter end, the authors show how the framework can be used to build portfolios using information about regimes as defined, to outperform a no-information equal-weight portfolio both out-of-sample and in bootstrapped and cross-validated simulations. The authors thus show that spectral clustering can provide both an elegant mathematical description of the leverage cycle and a robust foundation for quant-macro investing.},

  abstract       = {This paper discusses about an R package that implements the Pattern Sequence based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm, which was developed for univariate time series forecasting. This algorithm has been successfully applied to many different fields. The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts: clustering and prediction. The clustering part includes selection of the optimum number of clusters. It labels time series data with reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions to implement the PSF algorithm. It also contains a function which automates all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results. The aim of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its implementation with minimum efforts. This paper describes all the functions in the PSF package with their syntax. It also provides a simple example of usage. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and ets, well-known time series forecasting functions available on CRAN repository.},

  abstract             = {Similarity-based approaches represent a promising direction for time series analysis. However, many such methods rely on parameter tuning, and some have shortcomings if the time series are multivariate (MTS), due to dependencies between attributes, or the time series contain missing data. In this paper, we address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by proposing the robust time series cluster kernel (TCK). The approach taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) augmented with informative prior distributions. An ensemble learning approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel.

We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without missing data and outstanding results for missing data.},

  abstract       = {Time series are ubiquitous, and a measure to assess their similarity is a core part of many computational systems. In particular, the similarity measure is the most essential ingredient of time series clustering and classification systems. Because of this importance, countless approaches to estimate time series similarity have been proposed. However, there is a lack of comparative studies using empirical, rigorous, quantitative, and large-scale assessment strategies. In this article, we provide an extensive evaluation of similarity measures for time series classification following the aforementioned principles. We consider 7 different measures coming from alternative measure `families', and 45 publicly-available time series data sets coming from a wide variety of scientific domains. We focus on out-of-sample classification accuracy, but in-sample accuracies and parameter choices are also discussed. Our work is based on rigorous evaluation methodologies and includes the use of powerful statistical significance tests to derive meaningful conclusions. The obtained results show the equivalence, in terms of accuracy, of a number of measures, but with one single candidate outperforming the rest. Such findings, together with the followed methodology, invite researchers on the field to adopt a more consistent evaluation criteria and a more informed decision regarding the baseline measures to which new developments should be compared.},
